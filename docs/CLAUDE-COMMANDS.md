```javascript
describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('should create user with valid email and password', async () => {
    // Test existing registration flow
    expect(await register('user@example.com', 'validPassword')).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('should reject invalid email formats', async () => {
    // Test existing validation
    await expect(register('invalid-email', 'password')).rejects.toThrow();
  });
});
```

#### 1.2 Authentication Tests  
```javascript
describe('User Authentication', () => {
  it('should authenticate user with correct credentials', async () => {
    // Test current login process
  });

  it('should reject invalid credentials', async () => {
    // Test current security behavior
  });
});
```

#### 2.1 Improved Authentication API
```javascript
describe('Enhanced Authentication', () => {
  it('should support multiple authentication providers', async () => {
    // New functionality - will fail initially
    const auth = new AuthManager();
    await auth.configureProvider('google', googleConfig);
    expect(auth.getProviders()).toContain('google');
  });

  it('should provide unified user interface', async () => {
    // New abstraction - will fail initially
    const user = await auth.authenticate('email', credentials);
    expect(user).toMatchInterface(UnifiedUserInterface);
  });
});
```

## Git & Collaboration

### `/checkout`
**Purpose**: Smart branch switching and management with context awareness

**Best for**: Branch management, feature switching, maintaining clean git state

**Example Usage**:
```
User: Switch to the authentication feature branch

/checkout

I'll help you switch to the authentication branch safely...

## Branch Analysis

### Current State
- **Current branch**: `main`
- **Uncommitted changes**: 3 files modified
- **Untracked files**: 2 files (test artifacts)

### Available Branches
- `feat/auth-system` ← Target branch
- `feat/ui-improvements`
- `fix/login-validation`
- `main` (current)

### Switching Strategy

**Option 1: Commit current work**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "wip: save progress before switching branches"
git checkout feat/auth-system
```

**Option 2: Stash changes**
```bash
git stash push -m "temp work before auth branch"
git checkout feat/auth-system
# Later: git stash pop
```

**Option 3: Create WIP branch**
```bash
git checkout -b wip/main-progress
git add . && git commit -m "wip: temporary save"
git checkout feat/auth-system
```

### Recommendation
I recommend **Option 2 (stash)** because:
- Changes appear to be experimental/temporary
- No logical commit point reached yet
- Easy to recover if needed

Proceeding with stash approach...

```bash
git stash push -m "temp: main branch progress before auth work"
git checkout feat/auth-system
```

✅ Successfully switched to `feat/auth-system`
✅ Your work is safely stashed
✅ Ready to continue authentication development

**To recover your stashed work later:**
```bash
git checkout main
git stash pop
```
```

### `/create-worktree`
**Purpose**: Manage Git worktrees for parallel development across multiple features

**Best for**: Working on multiple features simultaneously, testing different approaches

**Example Usage**:
```
User: I need to work on the auth feature while keeping my main work available

/create-worktree

I'll set up a Git worktree for parallel development...

## Worktree Setup Plan

### Current Repository State
- **Main directory**: `/Users/dev/project`
- **Current branch**: `main`
- **Active work**: UI improvements (uncommitted)

### Proposed Worktree Structure
```
project/
├── main-repo/          # Original repository (UI work)
├── auth-worktree/      # New worktree for auth feature
└── testing-worktree/   # Future worktree for testing
```

### Creating Auth Worktree

```bash
# Create worktree for auth feature
git worktree add ../auth-worktree feat/auth-system

# Verify worktree creation
git worktree list
```

### Worktree Benefits
✅ **Parallel Development** - Work on auth without affecting UI work
✅ **Independent State** - Each worktree has its own working directory
✅ **Shared History** - All worktrees share the same Git history
✅ **Easy Switching** - Move between features by changing directories

### Development Workflow

**For Auth Work:**
```bash
cd ../auth-worktree
# Make auth-related changes
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add OAuth integration"
```

**For UI Work:**
```bash
cd ../main-repo  # Back to original directory
# Continue UI improvements
git add . && git commit -m "feat: improve login form styling"
```

### Worktree Management

**List all worktrees:**
```bash
git worktree list
```

**Remove worktree when done:**
```bash
git worktree remove ../auth-worktree
```

**Prune deleted worktrees:**
```bash
git worktree prune
```

✅ Worktree created successfully!
✅ You can now work on authentication in `../auth-worktree`
✅ Your main UI work remains untouched in current directory
```
