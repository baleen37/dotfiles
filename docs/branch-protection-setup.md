# Branch Protection Setup Guide

This document explains how to configure GitHub branch protection settings to prevent auto-merge when CI tests fail, while still allowing merge without code review.

## Issue Background

**Issue #403**: Auto-merge was happening regardless of CI test success/failure status.

**Root Cause**: Branch protection was enabled but `required_status_checks.enforcement_level` was set to "off" with no required checks configured.

## Solution

### 1. Configure Required Status Checks

The branch protection settings require specific CI workflows to pass before allowing merge:

- **Fast Tests** - Quick validation tests
- **Build Core** - Core system build verification  
- **CI** - Main continuous integration workflow
- **Security** - Security scanning and validation

### 2. Maintain Code Review Settings

To allow merge without code review while requiring CI:

- `required_approving_review_count: 0` (allows merge without review)
- `required_status_checks.strict: true` (requires CI to pass)

## Setup Instructions

### Automatic Setup

Run the branch protection setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
```

This script will:

1. ✅ Configure required status checks for main branch
2. ✅ Enable strict CI enforcement  
3. ✅ Maintain ability to merge without code review
4. ✅ Block force pushes and branch deletion
5. ✅ Verify configuration is applied correctly

### Manual Setup

If you need to configure manually via GitHub API:

```bash
# Get current repository info
REPO_FULL_NAME=$(gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '.owner.login + "/" + .name')

# Apply branch protection with required CI checks
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_FULL_NAME/branches/main/protection \
  -d '{
    "required_status_checks": {
      "strict": true,
      "contexts": ["Fast Tests", "Build Core", "CI", "Security"]
    },
    "enforce_admins": false,
    "required_pull_request_reviews": {
      "required_approving_review_count": 0,
      "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
      "require_code_owner_reviews": false
    },
    "restrictions": null,
    "allow_force_pushes": false,
    "allow_deletions": false
  }'
```

## Auto-Update Workflow Improvements

The auto-update workflow (`/.github/workflows/auto-update-flake.yml`) has been enhanced:

### Before (Problem)

- Only waited for CI checks to be "created"
- Enabled auto-merge immediately without waiting for completion
- No verification of CI success before merge

### After (Solution)  

- ✅ Waits for all required CI checks to complete successfully
- ✅ Monitors check status in real-time with detailed reporting
- ✅ Aborts auto-merge if any required check fails
- ✅ Double-verifies CI status before enabling auto-merge
- ✅ Provides clear error messages and status updates

### Key Improvements

1. **Real CI Completion Waiting**: Monitors actual check conclusions, not just creation
2. **Failure Detection**: Immediately aborts if any required check fails
3. **Status Verification**: Double-checks all required tests pass before merge
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed status reporting for debugging
5. **Timeout Protection**: 30-minute timeout prevents infinite waiting

## Verification

After setup, verify the configuration:

```bash
# Check current branch protection status
gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '.owner.login + "/" + .name')/branches/main/protection

# View required checks
gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '.owner.login + "/" + .name')/branches/main/protection | jq '.required_status_checks'
```

Expected output should show:

- `"strict": true`
- Required contexts: `["Fast Tests", "Build Core", "CI", "Security"]`
- `required_approving_review_count: 0`

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Create a test PR that intentionally fails CI
2. Verify auto-merge is NOT enabled
3. Create a test PR that passes all CI checks  
4. Verify auto-merge IS enabled and executes only after CI completion

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **CI tests must pass before merge**: Required status checks enforced
✅ **Merge without code review allowed**: `required_approving_review_count: 0`  
✅ **Auto-merge waits for CI completion**: Enhanced workflow verification
✅ **Failed CI prevents merge**: Failure detection and abort logic
✅ **Detailed status reporting**: Comprehensive logging throughout process

This solution maintains the convenience of auto-merge and no-review merging while ensuring CI integrity is never compromised.
