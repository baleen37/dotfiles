description: Execute commands using subagent-driven development approach
---

Use the superpowers:subagent-driven-development skill to execute any task or command.

This command transforms regular commands into subagent-driven execution:
- Creates fresh subagent for each independent task
- Provides code review between tasks for quality gates
- Enables fast iteration with systematic validation
- Maintains clear task separation and progress tracking

## Usage Examples

Execute existing commands with subagent approach:
- `/subagent-driven-development /write-plan` - Create implementation plans with subagents
- `/subagent-driven-development /execute-plan` - Execute plans using subagent dispatch
- `/subagent-driven-development /create-skill` - Develop skills with subagent-driven process
- `/subagent-driven-development /create-command` - Build commands with subagent oversight

Perfect for complex multi-step tasks where each step benefits from focused attention and intermediate quality checks.
