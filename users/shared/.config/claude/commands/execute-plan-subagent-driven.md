Use the superpowers:subagent-driven-development skill exactly as written

This command executes implementation plans using the subagent-driven approach:
- Dispatches fresh subagent for each independent task
- Provides code review between tasks for quality gates
- Enables fast iteration with systematic validation
- Maintains clear task separation and progress tracking

Perfect for executing complex multi-step plans where each task benefits from focused attention and intermediate quality checks.
