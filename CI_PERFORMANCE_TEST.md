# CI Performance Validation Test

## Purpose
Testing the new streamlined CI pipeline performance and functionality.

## Expected Results

### Draft PR Performance
- **Target**: ~30 seconds (smoke test only)
- **Previous**: 15-25 minutes (full pipeline)
- **Improvement**: 30-50x faster

### Ready PR Performance  
- **Target**: ~5-8 minutes (optimized pipeline)
- **Previous**: 15-25 minutes (redundant workflows)
- **Improvement**: 3-4x faster

## Test Scenarios

1. **Draft PR Test**: Create as draft → Should complete in ~30 seconds
2. **Ready PR Test**: Mark as ready → Should complete in ~5-8 minutes
3. **Core Platform Focus**: Verify ARM64 Darwin + x64 Linux builds
4. **Parallel Testing**: Confirm `test-parallel-*` infrastructure usage

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Draft PR triggers smoke test only
- [ ] Ready PR triggers full optimized pipeline
- [ ] Build focuses on core platforms (ARM64 Darwin, x64 Linux)
- [ ] Parallel tests execute concurrently
- [ ] Cache reuse between stages
- [ ] Smart conditional execution based on file changes
- [ ] PR status comments with performance metrics

## Performance Baseline

**Before Streamlined CI**:
- 8 separate workflows
- 14-20 parallel jobs
- 15-25 minute total time
- Redundant Nix installations and cache setups

**After Streamlined CI**:
- 1 unified workflow
- 6-8 optimized jobs
- 5-8 minute total time (3-4x improvement)
- Smart caching and parallel execution
