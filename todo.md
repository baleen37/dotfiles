## Quick Reference

### Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 5.5: Advanced video effects
2. Complete Phase 6.5: YouTube API integration
3. Start Phase 7: CLI implementation
4. Implement Phase 8: Scheduler system

### Blocking Issues
- None currently

### Dependencies
- FFmpeg binary required for video processing
- Google Cloud credentials for TTS
- YouTube API credentials for upload
- Stable Diffusion API for images

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific domain tests
go test -v ./internal/video/...
go test -v ./internal/youtube/...

# Run with real media (not mocked)
SKIP_FFMPEG_EXECUTION=false go test -v ./internal/video/integration_test.go

# Coverage report
make coverage
```

### Important Notes
- Always follow TDD: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor
- Maintain hexagonal architecture
- Update this file after completing each task
- Create issues for any bugs discovered
- Document all design decisions
