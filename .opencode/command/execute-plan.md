description: Execute detailed implementation plans in batches with review checkpoints
agent: build

I'm using the Executing Plans skill to implement this plan.

Current working directory: !`pwd`

Please provide the path to the plan file I should execute (e.g., `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`).

I'll:
1. Load and critically review the plan
2. Execute tasks in batches (default: first 3 tasks)
3. Run all verifications as specified
4. Report progress between batches for your review
5. Continue until all tasks are complete

Which plan file should I execute?
