I'm using the Brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design.

Current working directory: !`pwd`

I'll help you transform your rough idea into a fully-formed design through structured questioning and alternative exploration.

**My process:**
1. **Understanding** - Ask questions to clarify purpose, constraints, and success criteria
2. **Exploration** - Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
3. **Design Presentation** - Present architecture incrementally for validation
4. **Implementation Setup** - Set up isolated workspace if needed
5. **Planning Handoff** - Create detailed implementation plan

What idea would you like to brainstorm? Please describe:
- Your initial concept
- The problem you're trying to solve
- Any constraints or requirements you already know

I'll start by asking clarifying questions to understand your vision.
