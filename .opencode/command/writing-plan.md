description: Create detailed implementation plans with bite-sized tasks
agent: build
---

I'm using the Writing Plans skill to create the implementation plan.

Current working directory: !`pwd`

I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase. The plan will be saved to `docs/plans/` with bite-sized tasks following TDD principles.

Please provide:
1. The feature name and goal
2. The approved design/architecture
3. Key technologies or components involved

I'll structure the plan with:
- Exact file paths and code
- Step-by-step implementation (2-5 minutes per step)
- Test-driven development approach
- Frequent commit checkpoints
- Complete context for zero-knowledge developer

What feature should I create the implementation plan for?
