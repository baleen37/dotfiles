# Session: Claude Code Hooks Test
Date: 2025-08-15 12:50

## Context
Testing and fixing Claude Code hooks configuration for git commit validation.

## Problem Analysis
- Claude Code hooks were not working properly
- Settings.json had incorrect hook file paths
- Hook script (git-commit-validator.py) needed to be configured correctly

## Technical Implementation

### Fixed Issues
1. **Hook Path Configuration**
   - Changed relative paths to absolute paths in settings.json
   - Fixed: `hooks/git-commit-validator.py` â†’ `/Users/baleen/.claude/hooks/git-commit-validator.py`
   - Removed non-existent append_ultrathink.py hook

2. **Hook Testing Results**
   - Hook script works correctly when tested directly
   - --no-verify flag detection works as expected
   - Regular commits pass through without blocking

### Current State
- Settings.json properly configured with absolute paths
- PreToolUse hook set up for Bash commands
- git-commit-validator.py blocks --no-verify flag usage
- Requires Claude Code restart for settings to take effect

## Commands Used
```bash
# Test commits
git commit -m "Test" --no-verify
git commit -m "Hook test"

# Hook validation
echo '{"tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": {"command": "git commit -m \"Test\" --no-verify"}}' | python3 /Users/baleen/.claude/hooks/git-commit-validator.py
```

## Learning Insights
- Claude Code hooks require absolute paths in settings.json
- Hook changes may require Claude Code restart to take effect
- Exit code 2 in hooks blocks command execution and shows stderr to Claude
- Hooks can be tested independently by piping JSON input

## Next Steps
- Restart Claude Code for settings to take effect
- Verify hook blocking works in new session
- Consider adding more validation rules if needed

## Files Modified
- `/Users/baleen/.claude/settings.json` - Fixed hook paths
- Created test files: test.txt, hook-test.txt, blocked-test.txt, no-verify-test.txt

## Status: Complete
All configurations have been fixed. Hooks should work properly after Claude Code restart.
