# =============================================================================
# VM Shared Configuration Module
# =============================================================================
#
# This module provides the base configuration for NixOS virtual machines running
# in UTM on Apple Silicon. It contains common settings that apply across all
# VM instances regardless of specific hardware configuration.
#
# Purpose:
# - Establish base NixOS system configuration for development VMs
# - Provide common packages and services for development workflows
# - Configure virtualization-friendly defaults (no firewall, passwordless sudo)
# - Enable essential services (SSH, Docker) for development
#
# Design Philosophy:
# Simplified module signature with hardcoded values to reduce complexity for
# the current use case. The configuration assumes development VM usage with
# standard settings that work well across different UTM VM configurations.
#
# Usage:
# Imported by machine-specific configurations (e.g., vm-aarch64-utm.nix) which
# provide hardware-specific overrides and additional VM-specific settings.
