# Sample Assets for Mock Testing

This directory contains sample files for testing the mock implementations.

## Directory Structure

- `images/` - Sample images for mock image generation
- `audio/` - Sample audio files for mock TTS

## Note

In a real implementation, you would place actual sample files here:
- A few 1080x1920 vertical images (JPEG/PNG)
- A sample MP3 audio file (about 1 minute)

For now, the mock implementations will create placeholder files.
