# VM Testing Framework

This directory contains simple but functional VM boot tests using NixOS's built-in `nixosTest` framework.

## Tests

### `boot-test-minimal.nix`
A minimal VM boot test that verifies basic functionality without complex dependencies:

- VM boots to multi-user target
- User login works
- Basic file operations
- Network connectivity
- Essential programs (git, vim, curl, wget) are available
- Shell functionality works
- Hostname is set correctly

### `boot-test.nix`
A more comprehensive VM boot test that attempts to use the actual VM configuration from `machines/nixos-vm.nix`. This test may fail if NetworkManager or other dependencies are not available in the VM environment.

## Usage

### On Linux Systems

Run VM tests using the Make targets:

```bash
# Run minimal VM test (recommended)
make test-vm-minimal

# Run all VM tests (minimal + full)
make test-vm
```

### On macOS Systems

VM tests require Linux with QEMU support. To run VM tests on macOS, you can use Docker:

```bash
# Using Docker with NixOS
docker run -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/workspace nixos/nix:latest bash -c "cd /workspace && export USER=$(whoami) && make test-vm-minimal"
```

## Requirements

- Linux system with QEMU support
- Nix with flakes enabled
- Sufficient memory and disk space for VM (2GB RAM, 2GB disk by default)

## Test Output

Successful test output looks like:

```
âœ“ VM reached multi-user target
âœ“ User login works
âœ“ Basic file operations work
âœ“ Basic programs available
âœ“ User home directory exists
âœ“ Network connectivity works
âœ“ File creation and modification works
âœ“ Shell functionality works
âœ“ Hostname is set correctly
ðŸŽ‰ All VM boot tests passed!
```

## Troubleshooting

### "VM tests require Linux with QEMU support"
VM tests can only run on Linux systems with QEMU virtualization support. Use Docker with NixOS on macOS.

### Network connectivity failures
The minimal test uses systemd-networkd instead of NetworkManager for better VM compatibility.

### Memory/disk issues
Increase the memory and disk sizes in the test configuration if needed:

```nix
virtualisation.memorySize = 2048;  # 2GB RAM
virtualisation.diskSize = 4096;   # 4GB disk
```
