# Test Builders Unit Tests (Placeholder)
#
# This file is a placeholder for future test-builders.nix implementation
# The original lib/test-builders.nix was removed as dead code
#
# Original purpose:
# - Unit test builders for testing frameworks
# - Contract test builders for interface validation
# - Integration test builders for system testing
# - End-to-end test builders for workflow validation
#
# Note: If test-builders.nix is re-implemented in the future,
# these tests should be updated accordingly
