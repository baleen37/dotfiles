# Nix Library Functions Unit Tests (Placeholder)
#
# This file is a placeholder for future test-builders.nix implementation
# The original lib/test-builders.nix was removed as dead code
#
# Original purpose:
# - Testing test builder functions (unit, contract, integration, e2e builders)
# - Testing test utilities (suite builders, validators)
# - Testing platform and test case validation
# - Testing framework runners (nix-unit, bats, nixos-vm)
#
# Note: If test-builders.nix is re-implemented in the future,
# these tests should be updated accordingly
