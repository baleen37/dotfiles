## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Nix-based dotfiles project**: `tests/lib/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/e2e/`

## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies

- **Setup before Tests**: T001-T003 → T004-T015
- **Tests before Implementation**: T004-T015 → T016-T027  
- **Models before Services**: T016-T019 → T020-T023
- **Services before CLI**: T020-T023 → T024-T027
- **Core before Integration**: T016-T027 → T028-T034
- **Implementation before Polish**: T028-T034 → T035-T044

### Specific Blocking Dependencies

- T021 (smart selection) requires T020 (discovery)
- T022 (executor) requires T020, T021
- T024 (CLI) requires T020-T023 (all services)
- T028-T030 (integrations) require T024-T027 (CLI complete)

```bash
# Launch T004-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test for unified CLI interface in tests/unit/test-unified-cli-contract.sh"
Task: "Contract test for smart test selection API in tests/unit/test-smart-selection-contract.sh"
Task: "Contract test for backward compatibility in tests/integration/test-backward-compatibility.sh"
Task: "Contract test for performance requirements in tests/integration/test-performance-contract.sh"
```

### Phase 3.2 - Integration Tests (All Parallel)

```bash  
# Launch T008-T011 together:

Task: "Integration test for CI/CD pipeline compatibility in tests/integration/test-ci-integration.sh"
Task: "Integration test for existing test framework compatibility in tests/integration/test-framework-compatibility.sh"
Task: "Integration test for performance monitoring integration in tests/integration/test-performance-monitoring.sh"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Core Entities (All Parallel)

```bash
# Launch T016-T019 together:
Task: "TestSuite entity implementation in tests/lib/unified/test-suite.sh"
Task: "Test entity implementation in tests/lib/unified/test-entity.sh"
Task: "TestResult entity implementation in tests/lib/unified/test-result.sh"
Task: "TestConfig entity implementation in tests/lib/unified/test-config.sh"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no shared dependencies
- **CRITICAL**: Verify ALL tests fail before implementing (TDD RED phase)
- Commit after each task completion
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing `make test-*` commands
- Preserve existing 2-3s quick test performance
- All new code must integrate with existing tests/lib/test-framework.sh

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - unified-test-interface.md → T004 (CLI contract test) + T024-T027 (CLI implementation)
   - smart-test-selection.md → T005 (selection contract test) + T021 (selection implementation)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - TestSuite entity → T012 (test) + T016 (implementation)
   - Test entity → T013 (test) + T017 (implementation)
   - TestResult entity → T014 (test) + T018 (implementation)
   - TestConfig entity → T015 (test) + T019 (implementation)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Developer workflow → T008 (integration test)
   - Performance scenarios → T011, T039 (performance tests)
   - Migration validation → T042 (quickstart execution)

4. **From Research Decisions**:
   - Nix/Bash/BATS stack → T002 (configuration)
   - Existing system integration → T028-T030 (integration tasks)

## Validation Checklist ✓

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T007)

- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 → 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced
- [x] Backward compatibility preserved
- [x] Performance requirements maintained
