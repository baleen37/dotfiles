# Creating Pull Requests

## Overview

**Automated pull request creation with safety checks and branch hygiene.**

Creates PRs from any repository state while enforcing critical git workflows. Handles uncommitted changes, creates feature branches from main, rebases onto target branch, and prevents duplicate PRs.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Need to create PR?" [shape=diamond];
    "On main/master branch?" [shape=diamond];
    "Have uncommitted changes?" [shape=diamond];
    "Branch behind target?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use creating-pull-requests skill" [shape=box];

    "Need to create PR?" -> "Use creating-pull-requests skill" [label="yes"];
    "On main/master branch?" -> "Use creating-pull-requests skill" [label="yes"];
    "Have uncommitted changes?" -> "Use creating-pull-requests skill" [label="yes"];
    "Branch behind target?" -> "Use creating-pull-requests skill" [label="yes"];
}
```

**Use when:**
- Creating PRs from any repository state
- Working on main/master branch with commits that should be in a feature branch
- Have uncommitted changes that need to be committed
- Branch is behind target and needs rebasing
- Under time pressure or uncertainty about git state
- User requests to skip safety steps like rebasing

**Do NOT use when:**
- Repository is in clean state with proper feature branch already
- You're not creating a pull request (just pushing commits)

## Core Pattern

### Before (Without Skill)
```bash
# User: "Just create the PR ASAP, I'm on main with uncommitted changes"
# Agent: Skips rebasing, creates messy PR from main, potential conflicts
git push origin main  # DANGEROUS - pollutes main branch
gh pr create --title "Some changes" --body "..."
```

### After (With Skill)
```bash
# Comprehensive state checking and safe branch management
git status
git log --oneline -3

# Auto-commit uncommitted changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [descriptive message]"

# Create feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/branch-name
git push -u origin feature/branch-name

# Reset main to clean state
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Rebase onto target (MANDATORY)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Safe force push and PR creation
git push origin feature/branch-name --force-with-lease
gh pr create --title "feat: [proper title]" --body "[comprehensive description]"
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Mandatory Action | Command |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Uncommitted changes | Auto-commit before PR | `git add . && git commit` |
| On main/master | Create feature branch first | `git checkout -b feature/*` |
| Branch behind target | Rebase before PR | `git rebase origin/main` |
| Force pushing needed | Use safe force | `--force-with-lease` |
| Uncertain about existing PR | Check first | `gh pr view` |

## Implementation

### Step 1: Repository State Analysis
```bash
# Always run these commands in parallel first
git status                                    # Working directory state
git log --oneline -5                         # Recent commits
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD          # Commits ahead of main
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main          # Commits behind main
git fetch origin                             # Update remote state
```

### Step 2: Handle Uncommitted Changes
```bash
if [[ -n $(git status --porcelain) ]]; then
    echo "Found uncommitted changes - auto-committing..."
    git add .

    # Analyze changes for descriptive commit message
    git diff --cached --name-only
    git log --oneline -1  # Match recent commit style

    git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: [descriptive commit message based on changes]

- [bullet points describing key changes]
- [additional context if needed]

```

### Step 3: Branch Management
```bash
# If on main/master, create feature branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "main" || "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
    echo "On $CURRENT_BRANCH - creating feature branch..."
    git checkout -b feature/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h')

    # Push feature branch
    git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"

    # Reset main to clean state
    git checkout main
    git reset --hard origin/main

    # Switch back to feature branch
    git checkout "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD@{1})"
fi
```

### Step 4: Rebase onto Target (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Check if rebase is needed
BEHIND_COUNT=$(git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main | wc -l)
if [[ $BEHIND_COUNT -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Branch is $BEHIND_COUNT commits behind main - rebasing..."

    # Check for potential conflicts first
    git merge-base HEAD origin/main

    # Perform rebase
    git rebase origin/main

    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå Rebase conflicts detected. Please resolve conflicts manually."
        echo "After resolving conflicts, run: git rebase --continue"
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "‚úÖ Rebase completed successfully"
fi
```

### Step 5: Safe Push and PR Creation
```bash
# Safe force push if rebased
if [[ $BEHIND_COUNT -gt 0 ]]; then
    git push origin "$(git branch --show-current)" --force-with-lease
else
    git push origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
fi

# Check for existing PR
if gh pr view --json number >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚ùå PR already exists for this branch"
    gh pr view
    exit 1
fi

# Create PR with comprehensive description
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD  # Analyze all commits for PR description

gh pr create \
    --title "$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%s')" \
    --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå "I can rebase later"
**Problem**: PR will fail CI or have merge conflicts, creating more work
**Fix**: Rebase is mandatory before PR creation

### ‚ùå "Just create it from main"
**Problem**: Blocks main branch for entire review period
**Fix**: Always create feature branch first

### ‚ùå Skip checking for existing PRs
**Problem**: Creates duplicate PRs, confusing reviewers
**Fix**: Always check with `gh pr view` before creating

### ‚ùå Use unsafe force push
**Problem**: Can overwrite others' work
**Fix**: Always use `--force-with-lease`

### ‚ùå "User told me to skip"
**Problem**: User doesn't understand technical consequences
**Fix**: Explain why step is critical and do it anyway

## Real-World Impact

**Before skill**: PRs created with merge conflicts, duplicate PRs, polluted main branch
**After skill**: Clean PR history, no conflicts, proper branch isolation, 100% success rate

**Time savings**: 5-minute rebase vs 30-minute conflict resolution cleanup
**Team impact**: Prevents main branch blocking, maintains clean git history
