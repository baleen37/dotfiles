# User Authentication System PRD

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive user authentication system to replace the current basic login functionality. The system should support modern authentication patterns, security best practices, and provide a seamless user experience.

## Business Requirements

### Primary Goals
- **Secure Authentication**: Implement industry-standard security practices
- **User Experience**: Provide smooth login/registration flows
- **Scalability**: Support up to 100K users initially
- **Compliance**: Meet GDPR and SOC2 requirements

### Success Metrics
- Authentication success rate >99.5%
- Password reset completion rate >80%
- Average login time <2 seconds
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

## Functional Requirements

### User Registration
- Email-based registration with verification
- Password strength validation
- CAPTCHA integration for bot prevention
- Welcome email sequence
- Account activation workflow

### User Login
- Email/password authentication
- "Remember me" functionality
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Password reset via email
- Social login integration (Google, GitHub)

### Session Management
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure session storage
- Token refresh mechanism
- Multi-device session handling
- Forced logout capability

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- 2FA support (TOTP)
- Audit logging for auth events
- Suspicious activity detection

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Components
- **Authentication Service**: Core auth logic and JWT handling
- **User Service**: User CRUD operations and profile management
- **Email Service**: Transactional emails and templates
- **Audit Service**: Security event logging and monitoring

### Frontend Components
- **Login Form**: Responsive login interface
- **Registration Form**: Multi-step registration process
- **Password Reset**: Forgot password flow
- **User Dashboard**: Account settings and security options
- **Admin Panel**: User management for administrators

### Database Schema
- Users table with encrypted PII
- Sessions table for active sessions
- Audit logs table for security events
- Email verification tokens table

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout
POST /api/auth/refresh
POST /api/auth/forgot-password
POST /api/auth/reset-password
GET  /api/auth/verify-email/:token
POST /api/auth/resend-verification
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Login response time: <500ms
- Registration process: <2 seconds
- Password reset: <1 second
- Support 1000 concurrent users

### Security
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- All passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost 12)
- JWT tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per minute

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Database connection pooling
- Redis for session storage
- CDN for static assets

## Dependencies

### External Services
- Email provider (SendGrid/Mailgun)
- Redis for caching
- Certificate authority for HTTPS
- CDN service (CloudFlare)

### Internal Dependencies
- User profile service
- Notification service
- Admin dashboard
- Mobile app integration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Registration Flow
- [ ] User can register with valid email/password
- [ ] Email verification required before login
- [ ] Password meets strength requirements
- [ ] Registration blocked for existing emails
- [ ] Welcome email sent successfully

### Login Flow
- [ ] User can login with verified credentials
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error
- [ ] Account locks after 5 failed attempts
- [ ] "Remember me" persists for 30 days
- [ ] Successful login redirects to dashboard

### Security Requirements
- [ ] All passwords properly hashed
- [ ] JWT tokens signed and validated
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force
- [ ] Audit logs capture all auth events
- [ ] 2FA can be enabled/disabled

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Login completes within 500ms
- [ ] Registration completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] System handles 1000 concurrent users
- [ ] No memory leaks in long-running sessions

## Risks and Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Data breach**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit
- **Password vulnerabilities**: Use bcrypt with high cost factor
- **Session hijacking**: Secure JWT implementation with short expiry

### Medium Risk
- **Email delivery issues**: Multiple email provider fallbacks
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Load testing and optimization
- **Third-party dependencies**: Vendor evaluation and SLAs

### Low Risk
- **UI/UX issues**: User testing and feedback loops
- **Browser compatibility**: Cross-browser testing strategy
- **Mobile responsive**: Progressive web app approach
