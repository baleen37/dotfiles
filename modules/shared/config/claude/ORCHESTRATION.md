4. Run tests at each step
5. Performance comparison analysis --optimize
6. Final quality verification
```

## Learning-Based Automatic Suggestions

### superclaude Context Intelligence

**Predictive Flag Engine** (Zero-config activation):
- **Performance Issues** → `--optimize + performance-engineer` (auto-triggered)
- **Security Concerns** → `--ultrathink + security-auditor` (priority activation)
- **Complex Debugging** → `--debug + debugger` (immediate deployment)
- **Large Codebase** → `--uc` token efficiency mode (smart detection)

**Proactive Mode Intelligence**:
