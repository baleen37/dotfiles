## Workflow Guidelines
When I make a request, separate the approach and execution phases. First, propose the approach and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation. Only ask for approval when work is complex or involves significant changes.

When creating pull requests, always follow the repository's PR template if one exists. Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review.

## Language and Attribution Guidelines
- Write all commit messages and PR descriptions in Korean
- Branch names should be written in English
- Always attribute work to the user, never mention AI assistance
- Write all commits and documentation as if the work was done manually by the user

## Important Note
Do not reference Claude Code in commit messages or PR descriptions. Write commits and documentation as if the work was done manually without AI assistance.
