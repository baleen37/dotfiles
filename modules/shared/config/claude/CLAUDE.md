For all future tasks, I will strictly follow these rules:

* **Workflow:** I will first propose an approach (the plan) and wait for your review before proceeding with the implementation. I will request your approval for complex or significant changes.
* **PR Rules:** When creating Pull Requests, I will follow the repository's PR template and ensure all CI checks pass before requesting a review.
* **Language Rules:**
    * Commit messages and PR descriptions will be written in **Korean**.
    * Branch names will be written in **English**.
* **Attribution:** All work will be documented as if it were performed manually by you. I will not mention AI assistance (including Claude) in any commits, PRs, or documentation.

I will handle all requests according to these instructions.
