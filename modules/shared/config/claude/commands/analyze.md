# /analyze - Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

**Purpose**: Automatically assess project situation to prioritize the most urgent issues, with optional $ARGUMENTS for additional focus areas, delivering actionable improvement recommendations.

## Fully Automated Analysis

AI scans the project and automatically determines priorities for analysis:

```bash
/analyze                    # AI automatically judges and analyzes everything

# AI's automatic decision process:
# 1. Project scan: Auto-detect tech stack, file structure, git history
# 2. Issue detection: Auto-identify error logs, performance metrics, stability risks
# 3. Priority ranking: Auto-prioritize by urgency and impact
# 4. Optimal strategy: Auto-select appropriate analysis tools and agents
# 5. Execute & report: Perform analysis and provide actionable solutions

# When $ARGUMENTS provided, used as additional focus areas
/analyze "seems slow"           # AI base analysis + performance focus
/analyze "errors happening"     # AI base analysis + stability focus
```

## Core Features

### üéØ Multi-Dimensional Analysis Engine
- **Architecture**: Module dependencies, coupling analysis, design pattern evaluation
- **Performance**: Bottleneck identification, resource usage patterns, optimization opportunities
- **Quality**: Code complexity, technical debt measurement, maintainability metrics
- **Stability**: Error patterns, test coverage, exception handling
- **Compliance**: Framework conventions, industry standard adherence

### üß† Intelligent Context Recognition
- **Auto tech stack detection**: Automatically parse package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.
- **Problem pattern recognition**: Analyze git commits, error logs, performance metrics to auto-detect issues
- **Auto priority determination**: Automatically rank importance as Stability > Performance > Quality
- **Optimal tool selection**: Auto-select most effective analysis tools based on situation

### ‚ö° Smart Agent Routing & Performance Optimization

| Processing Mode | Analysis Time | Token Usage | Accuracy | Recommended Use |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Default Mode | 3-5 min | 100% | 85% | General analysis |
| Agent Mode | 1-3 min | 70% | 90% | Expert-level analysis |
| Critical Scope | 1-2 min | 50% | 95% | Urgent issue diagnosis |

**Parallel Processing Architecture**:
- **Context Sharing**: 50% I/O savings through shared file reads
- **Adaptive Routing**: Auto-select optimal agents by issue type
- **Token Optimization**: 30% cost reduction through deduplication

## Automatic Agent Selection

AI automatically selects optimal agents based on project scan results:

| Detected Situation | Auto-Selected Agent | Processing Content |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Errors/Crashes Found** | debugger | Log analysis, error pattern tracking, root cause identification |
| **Performance Degradation** | performance-optimizer | Bottleneck identification, memory usage, optimization strategies |
| **Complex Issues** | root-cause-analyzer | Multi-issue correlation, system-wide analysis |
| **Structural Problems** | system-architect | Architecture evaluation, scalability review, design improvements |
| **Compound Issues** | Multi-agent parallel | Multiple experts simultaneously analyze from different angles |

## Practical Usage Examples

### Fully Automatic Mode
```bash
/analyze                        # AI automatically judges and executes everything

# What AI does automatically:
# 1. Project scan ‚Üí Detect React + TypeScript project
# 2. Error log check ‚Üí Find memory leak patterns
# 3. Performance metrics ‚Üí Detect rendering bottlenecks
# 4. Git history ‚Üí Discover recent performance-related commit increases
# 5. Priority decision ‚Üí Determine stability issues are most urgent
# 6. Agent selection ‚Üí Run debugger + performance-optimizer simultaneously
# 7. Analysis & report ‚Üí Provide specific solutions with code examples
```

### With Additional Hints
```bash
/analyze "seems slow"               # AI base analysis + performance focus
/analyze "errors frequently"        # AI base analysis + stability focus
/analyze "code needs cleanup"       # AI base analysis + architecture focus
/analyze "quality check"            # AI base analysis + code quality focus
```

### Example Results
```
ü§ñ Issues automatically detected by AI:

üî¥ Critical (Immediate Action Required)

## Error Handling & Alternative Strategies

### Natural Language Option Processing
```bash
# AI automatically determines processing method
/analyze "urgent stability issues first"            ‚Üí auto-set critical scope
/analyze "comprehensive full analysis"              ‚Üí auto-set full scope  
/analyze "stable step-by-step analysis"            ‚Üí auto-set sequential mode
/analyze "results in JSON format"                  ‚Üí auto-set json format

# Complex requirements in natural language
/analyze "quick performance check only"            ‚Üí performance + critical + fast mode
/analyze "thorough memory leak investigation"      ‚Üí memory analysis + full + documentation
```

### Automatic Analysis Mode Selection
- **critical**: Triggered by "urgent", "first", "important only" keywords
- **full**: Triggered by "comprehensive", "thorough", "all", "complete" keywords
- **sequential**: Triggered by "stable", "step-by-step", "gradual" keywords  
- **json/markdown**: Triggered by "JSON", "report", "document" keywords
