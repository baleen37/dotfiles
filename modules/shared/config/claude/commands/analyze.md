Analyze the codebase, error, or specific component. Identify problems, suggest improvements, and provide actionable recommendations.

**Use Serena MCP for all code analysis.**

**Priority**: Critical → High → Medium → Low issues

**Auto-detects**: Code quality, security risks, performance bottlenecks

**Output**: Prioritized findings with actionable recommendations

## Analysis Flow

1. **Discover**: Map files and identify analysis targets
2. **Scan**: Apply quality, security, performance checks
3. **Prioritize**: Rank issues by severity and impact
4. **Recommend**: Provide specific, actionable fixes

For errors: Find root cause and suggest fixes.
For code: Review quality, performance, and best practices.
For architecture: Assess design patterns and structure.
