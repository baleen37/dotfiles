description: "Interactive idea development through Q&A to create detailed specs"
---

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

**CRITICAL: During brainstorming, you MUST NOT modify any code whatsoever. Your role is STRICTLY LIMITED to asking questions and developing specifications through conversation. Any code changes are FORBIDDEN during this process.**

## Specification Development Process

1. Ask clarifying questions one at a time to develop thorough understanding
2. Mark ALL ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] during conversation
3. Build detailed specification iteratively following spec template structure
4. Use Review & Acceptance Checklist before completion

## Spec Template Structure

### Feature Overview
- **Name**: [Feature name]
- **Description**: [Brief description]
- **User Value**: [Why this matters]

### User Stories & Scenarios
- **Primary User Journey**: [Step-by-step flow]
- **Edge Cases**: [Alternative scenarios]
- **Success Criteria**: [Measurable outcomes]

### Requirements
- **Functional**: [What the system must do]
- **Non-functional**: [Performance, security, etc.]
- **Constraints**: [Technical/business limitations]

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality Checklist
- [ ] No implementation details included
- [ ] Focused on user value and experience
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness Checklist
- [ ] No "[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]" markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### Execution Status
- [ ] User description parsed
- [ ] Key concepts extracted
- [ ] Ambiguities marked and resolved
- [ ] User scenarios defined
- [ ] Requirements generated
- [ ] Review checklist passed

**Exit Gate**: All checklists completed â†’ Save as spec.md

Ask if the user wants to create a git repo on github. if so, commit the spec.md to git and push it to the newly created git repo.

Here's the idea:
