<objective>
Collaboratively develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for a new idea. This process involves analyzing the existing codebase to ground the specification in current conventions and architecture, asking targeted questions to clarify details, and producing a detailed document ready for a developer.
</objective>

<brainstorming>
1.  **Context Analysis**: Before asking questions, analyze the existing codebase to understand relevant conventions, architecture, and existing implementations. Use tools like `search_file_content`, `glob`, and `read_file` to find similar features or related code.
2.  **Iterative Questioning**: Based on the initial idea and the context analysis, ask the user one question at a time to dig into every relevant detail. Each question should build on previous answers and the information gathered from the code.
3.  **Specification Generation**: Once all details are clarified, create a comprehensive specification and save it as `spec.md`.
