## Socratic Dialogue Framework

### Phase 1: Initialization
1. **Context Setup**: Create brainstorming session with metadata
2. **TodoWrite Integration**: Initialize phase tracking tasks
3. **Session State**: Establish dialogue parameters and objectives
4. **Brief Template**: Prepare structured brief format
5. **Directory Creation**: Ensure ClaudeDocs/Brief/ exists

### Phase 2: Discovery Dialogue
1. **🔍 Discovery Phase**
   - Open-ended exploration questions
   - Domain understanding and context gathering
   - Stakeholder identification
   - Initial requirement sketching
   - Pattern: "Let me understand...", "Tell me about...", "What prompted..."

2. **💡 Exploration Phase**
   - Deep-dive into possibilities
   - What-if scenarios and alternatives
   - Feasibility assessment
   - Constraint identification
   - Pattern: "What if we...", "Have you considered...", "How might..."

3. **🎯 Convergence Phase**
   - Priority crystallization
   - Decision making support
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Requirement finalization
   - Pattern: "Based on our discussion...", "The priority seems to be..."

### Phase 3: Brief Generation
1. **Requirement Synthesis**: Compile discovered requirements
2. **Metadata Creation**: Generate comprehensive brief metadata
3. **Structure Validation**: Ensure brief completeness
4. **Persistence**: Save to ClaudeDocs/Brief/{project}-brief-{timestamp}.md
5. **Quality Check**: Validate against minimum requirements

### Phase 4: Agent Handoff (if --prd specified)
1. **Brief Validation**: Ensure readiness for PRD generation
2. **Agent Invocation**: Call brainstorm-PRD with structured brief
3. **Context Transfer**: Pass session history and decisions
4. **Link Creation**: Connect brief to generated PRD
5. **Completion Report**: Summarize outcomes and next steps

## Auto-Activation Patterns
- **Vague Requests**: "I want to build something that..."
- **Exploration Keywords**: brainstorm, explore, figure out, not sure
- **Uncertainty Indicators**: maybe, possibly, thinking about, could we
- **Planning Needs**: new project, startup idea, feature concept
- **Discovery Requests**: help me understand, what should I build

## MODE Integration

### MODE-Command Architecture
The brainstorm command integrates with MODE_Brainstorming for behavioral configuration and auto-activation:

```yaml
mode_command_integration:
  primary_implementation: "/sc:brainstorm"
  parameter_mapping:
    # MODE YAML Setting → Command Parameter
    max_rounds: "--max-rounds"           # Default: 15
    depth_level: "--depth"              # Default: normal  
    focus_area: "--focus"               # Default: balanced
    auto_prd: "--prd"                   # Default: false
    brief_template: "--template"        # Default: standard
  override_precedence: "explicit > mode > framework > system"
  coordination_workflow:
    - mode_detection          # MODE evaluates request context
    - parameter_inheritance   # YAML settings → command parameters
    - command_invocation     # /sc:brainstorm executed
    - behavioral_enforcement # MODE patterns applied
    - quality_validation     # Framework compliance checked
```

### Behavioral Configuration
- **Dialogue Style**: collaborative_non_presumptive
- **Discovery Depth**: adaptive based on project complexity
- **Context Retention**: cross_session memory persistence
- **Handoff Automation**: true for seamless agent transitions

### Plan Mode Integration

**Seamless Plan-to-Brief Workflow** - Automatically transforms planning discussions into structured briefs.

When SuperClaude detects requirement-related content in Plan Mode:

1. **Trigger Detection**: Keywords (implement, build, create, design, develop, feature) or explicit content (requirements, specifications, user stories)
2. **Content Transformation**: Automatically parses plan content into structured brief format
3. **Persistence**: Saves to `ClaudeDocs/Brief/plan-{project}-{timestamp}.md` with plan-mode metadata
4. **Workflow Integration**: Brief formatted for immediate brainstorm-PRD handoff
5. **Context Preservation**: Maintains complete traceability from plan to PRD

```yaml
plan_analysis:
  content_detection: [requirements, specifications, features, user_stories]
  scope_indicators: [new_functionality, system_changes, components]
  transformation_triggers: [explicit_prd_request, implementation_planning]

brief_generation:
  source_metadata: plan-mode
  auto_generated: true
  structure: [vision, requirements, approach, criteria, notes]
  format: brainstorm-PRD compatible
```

#### Integration Benefits
- **Zero Context Loss**: Complete planning history preserved in brief
- **Automated Workflow**: Plan → Brief → PRD with no manual intervention
- **Consistent Structure**: Plan content automatically organized for PRD generation
- **Time Efficiency**: Eliminates manual brief creation and formatting

## Communication Style

### Dialogue Principles
- **Collaborative**: "Let's explore this together..."
- **Non-Presumptive**: Avoid solution bias early in discovery
- **Progressive**: Build understanding incrementally
- **Reflective**: Mirror and validate understanding frequently

### Question Framework
- **Open Discovery**: "What would success look like?"
- **Clarification**: "When you say X, do you mean Y or Z?"
- **Exploration**: "How might this work in practice?"
- **Validation**: "Am I understanding correctly that...?"
- **Prioritization**: "What's most important to get right?"
