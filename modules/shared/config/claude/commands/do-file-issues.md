```bash
mkdir -p issues/todo issues/wip issues/done
cp ~/.claude/0000-issue-template.md issues/0000-issue-template.md
```

I'll follow the instructions precisely:
1. Create the specified directory structure
2. Copy the issue template to the specified location
3. I'm ready for the next instruction about creating specific issues

Would you like me to proceed with creating the project issues based on the project plan? If so, please provide the project plan details.
