  ## 1. Specification and Technology Alignment
  - [ ] Request specification if not provided. If it concerns existing code, locate the code first.
  - [ ] Analyze the specification.
  - [ ] Analyze the existing codebase (structure, conventions, tech) using `glob`, `search_file_content`, and `read_file`.
  - [ ] Propose and justify technology choices based on analysis and project goals.
  - [ ] Get user approval on technology choices, iterating as needed.

  ## 2. Blueprint and Task Breakdown
  - [ ] Draft a detailed, step-by-step implementation blueprint based on codebase analysis.
  - [ ] Decompose the blueprint into small, independent, and meaningful work items.

  ## 3. Finalization
  - [ ] Consolidate the steps into a final, phase-organized project plan.
  - [ ] Save the final plan to `plan.md`.
