<command>
/do-plan - Sequential Plan Execution

<purpose>
Execute the task list generated by `/plan` command in sequential order, tracking progress with TodoWrite.
</purpose>

<core-concept>
`/do-plan` simply:
1. Takes the task list from `/plan` output
2. Adds all tasks to TodoWrite
3. Executes each task in order
4. Tracks completion status
</core-concept>

<usage>
```bash
/do-plan                    # Execute all remaining tasks until completion
```
</usage>

<process>
1. **Loads the plan** from the most recent `/plan` output
2. **Creates TodoWrite entries** for each task with proper hierarchy  
3. **Executes ALL remaining tasks sequentially** until plan completion:
   - Marks current task as `in_progress`
   - Performs the task as described in the plan
   - Marks as `completed` when done
   - Automatically moves to the next task
   - Continues until ALL tasks are completed
</process>

<example-execution>
Given this plan:
```
Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Configure base dependencies

Phase 2: Core Features  
- [ ] Implement user model
- [ ] Create authentication service
- [ ] Build API endpoints
```

`/do-plan` will:
1. Add all 6 tasks to TodoWrite
2. Execute "Set up development environment"
3. Execute "Initialize project structure"
4. Execute "Configure base dependencies"
5. Continue with Phase 2 tasks...
</example-execution>

<progress-display>
```
=== Executing Plan ===

Phase 1: Foundation [2/3]
✓ Set up development environment
✓ Initialize project structure
⚡ Configure base dependencies [in progress]

Phase 2: Core Features [0/3]
○ Implement user model
○ Create authentication service
○ Build API endpoints

Overall: 33% complete (2/6 tasks)
```
</progress-display>

<options>
- None - simple sequential execution of the plan
</options>

<notes>
- **Complete Execution**: Runs ALL tasks until plan is 100% complete
- **Automatic Continuation**: No need to run `/do-plan` multiple times
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress display with TodoWrite
- **Resumable**: If interrupted, restart with `/do-plan` to continue from where it left off
