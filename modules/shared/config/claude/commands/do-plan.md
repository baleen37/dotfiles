# /do-plan - Sequential Plan Execution

**Purpose**: Execute the task list generated by `/plan` command in sequential order, tracking progress with TodoWrite.

## Core Concept

`/do-plan` simply:
1. Takes the task list from `/plan` output
2. Adds all tasks to TodoWrite
3. Executes each task in order
4. Tracks completion status

## Usage

```bash
# After generating a plan
/plan "authentication system"

# Execute the plan
/do-plan
```

## What It Does

1. **Loads the plan** from the most recent `/plan` output
2. **Creates TodoWrite entries** for each task with proper hierarchy
3. **Executes tasks sequentially**:
   - Marks current task as `in_progress`
   - Performs the task as described in the plan
   - Marks as `completed` when done
   - Moves to the next task

## Example Execution

Given this plan:
```
Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Configure base dependencies

Phase 2: Core Features  
- [ ] Implement user model
- [ ] Create authentication service
- [ ] Build API endpoints
```

`/do-plan` will:
1. Add all 6 tasks to TodoWrite
2. Execute "Set up development environment"
3. Execute "Initialize project structure"
4. Execute "Configure base dependencies"
5. Continue with Phase 2 tasks...

## Progress Display

```
=== Executing Plan ===

Phase 1: Foundation [2/3]
✓ Set up development environment
✓ Initialize project structure
⚡ Configure base dependencies [in progress]

Phase 2: Core Features [0/3]
○ Implement user model
○ Create authentication service
○ Build API endpoints

Overall: 33% complete (2/6 tasks)
```

## Options

- None - simple sequential execution of the plan

## Notes

- The plan already contains all execution details
- Each task is executed exactly as described in the plan
- Progress is saved, allowing interruption and resumption
- No complex routing needed - just follow the plan
