# /sc:task - Enhanced Task Management

## Triggers

- Complex tasks requiring multi-agent coordination and delegation
- Projects needing structured workflow management and cross-session persistence
- Operations requiring intelligent MCP server routing and domain expertise
- Tasks benefiting from systematic execution and progressive enhancement

## Usage

```
/sc:task [action] [target] [--strategy systematic|agile|enterprise] [--parallel] [--delegate]
```

## Behavioral Flow

1. **Analyze**: Parse task requirements and determine optimal execution strategy
2. **Delegate**: Route to appropriate MCP servers and activate relevant personas
3. **Coordinate**: Execute tasks with intelligent workflow management and parallel processing
4. **Validate**: Apply quality gates and comprehensive task completion verification
5. **Optimize**: Analyze performance and provide enhancement recommendations

Key behaviors:

- Multi-persona coordination across architect, frontend, backend, security, devops domains
- Intelligent MCP server routing (Sequential, Context7, Magic, Playwright, Morphllm, Serena)
- Systematic execution with progressive task enhancement and cross-session persistence
- Advanced task delegation with hierarchical breakdown and dependency management

## MCP Integration

- **Sequential MCP**: Complex multi-step task analysis and systematic execution planning
- **Context7 MCP**: Framework-specific patterns and implementation best practices
- **Magic MCP**: UI/UX task coordination and design system integration
- **Playwright MCP**: Testing workflow integration and validation automation
- **Morphllm MCP**: Large-scale task transformation and pattern-based optimization
- **Serena MCP**: Cross-session task persistence and project memory management

## Tool Coordination

- **TodoWrite**: Hierarchical task breakdown and progress tracking across Epic → Story → Task levels
- **Task**: Advanced delegation for complex multi-agent coordination and sub-task management
- **Read/Write/Edit**: Task documentation and implementation coordination
- **sequentialthinking**: Structured reasoning for complex task dependency analysis

## Key Patterns

- **Task Hierarchy**: Epic-level objectives → Story coordination → Task execution → Subtask granularity
- **Strategy Selection**: Systematic (comprehensive) → Agile (iterative) → Enterprise (governance)
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Persona activation → MCP routing → parallel execution → result integration
- **Cross-Session Management**: Task persistence → context continuity → progressive enhancement

## Examples

### Complex Feature Development

```
/sc:task create "enterprise authentication system" --strategy systematic --parallel
# Comprehensive task breakdown with multi-domain coordination
# Activates architect, security, backend, frontend personas
```

### Agile Sprint Coordination

```
/sc:task execute "feature backlog" --strategy agile --delegate
# Iterative task execution with intelligent delegation
# Cross-session persistence for sprint continuity
```

### Multi-Domain Integration

```
/sc:task execute "microservices platform" --strategy enterprise --parallel
# Enterprise-scale coordination with compliance validation
# Parallel execution across multiple technical domains
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**

- Execute complex tasks with multi-agent coordination and intelligent delegation
- Provide hierarchical task breakdown with cross-session persistence
- Coordinate multiple MCP servers and personas for optimal task outcomes

**Will Not:**

- Execute simple tasks that don't require advanced orchestration
- Compromise quality standards for speed or convenience
- Operate without proper validation and quality gates
