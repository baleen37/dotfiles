## Analysis Modes

### Discussion Mode (`--mode discussion`)

**Purpose**: Collaborative improvement through expert dialogue and knowledge sharing

**Expert Interaction Pattern**:

- Sequential expert commentary building upon previous insights
- Cross-expert validation and refinement of recommendations
- Consensus building around critical improvements
- Collaborative solution development

**Example Output**:

```
KARL WIEGERS: "The requirement 'SHALL handle failures gracefully' lacks specificity.
What constitutes graceful handling? What types of failures are we addressing?"

MICHAEL NYGARD: "Building on Karl's point, we need specific failure modes: network
timeouts, service unavailable, rate limiting. Each requires different handling strategies."

GOJKO ADZIC: "Let's make this concrete with examples:
  Given: Service timeout after 30 seconds
  When: Circuit breaker activates
  Then: Return cached response within 100ms"

MARTIN FOWLER: "The specification should also define the failure notification interface.
How do upstream services know what type of failure occurred?"
```

### Critique Mode (`--mode critique`)

**Purpose**: Systematic review with specific improvement suggestions and priority rankings

**Analysis Structure**:

- Issue identification with severity classification
- Specific improvement recommendations with rationale
- Priority ranking based on impact and effort
- Quality metrics and validation criteria

**Example Output**:

```
=== REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS ===

KARL WIEGERS - Requirements Quality Assessment:
‚ùå CRITICAL: Requirement R-001 lacks measurable acceptance criteria
üìù RECOMMENDATION: Replace "handle failures gracefully" with "open circuit breaker after 5 consecutive failures within 30 seconds"
üéØ PRIORITY: High - Affects testability and validation
üìä QUALITY IMPACT: +40% testability, +60% clarity

GOJKO ADZIC - Specification Testability:
‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR: No executable examples provided for complex behaviors
üìù RECOMMENDATION: Add Given/When/Then scenarios for each requirement
üéØ PRIORITY: Medium - Improves understanding and validation
üìä QUALITY IMPACT: +50% comprehensibility, +35% validation coverage

=== ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS ===

MARTIN FOWLER - Interface Design:
‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR: CircuitBreaker interface couples state management with execution logic
üìù RECOMMENDATION: Separate CircuitBreakerState from CircuitBreakerExecutor
üéØ PRIORITY: Low - Design improvement, not functional issue
üìä QUALITY IMPACT: +20% maintainability, +15% testability
```

### Socratic Mode (`--mode socratic`)

**Purpose**: Learning-focused questioning to deepen understanding and improve thinking

**Question Categories**:

MICHAEL NYGARD: "What assumptions are you making about the deployment environment and operational context?"

GOJKO ADZIC: "How would you explain these requirements to a non-technical business stakeholder?"

MARTIN FOWLER: "What would happen if we removed this requirement entirely? What breaks?"

LISA CRISPIN: "How would you validate that this specification is working correctly in production?"
