# /restore - Restore Todos & Plans

**Purpose**: Load previously saved todo states and work plans

## Usage

```bash
/restore                     # List available saved plans
/restore <name>              # Restore specific plan by name/search
```

## Execution Flow

1. **List mode**: Show available `plan_*.md` files with previews
2. **Restore mode**: Load selected plan and restore TodoWrite state
3. **Confirmation**: Show what will be restored before applying

## List Display

```
ðŸ“‹ Found 3 saved plans:

âœ… Completed (2):
  - Analyze current command structure  
  - Gather user requirements

ðŸ”„ In Progress (1):

```

## Implementation
1. Find and parse `plan_*.json` files
2. Show previews with todo counts and context  
3. For restore: use TodoWrite to recreate exact state
4. Simple name matching (fuzzy search on partial names)
