1. **Review the GitHub issues** and choose a small, quick-to-complete task.
2. **Plan your approach** carefully and post that plan as a comment on the chosen issue.
3. **Create a new branch** and implement your solution:
    - Write robust, well-documented code.
    - Include thorough tests and ample debug logging.
    - Ensure all tests pass before moving on.
4. **Open a pull request** once youâ€™re confident in your solution and push all changes to GitHub. Each pull request should be based on the previous branch since we haven't merged any branches into main yet
6. **Keep the issue open** until your PR is merged.
