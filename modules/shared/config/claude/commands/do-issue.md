</persona>

<objective>
  To systematically resolve a given GitHub issue by implementing, testing, and submitting a high-quality Pull Request.
</objective>

<workflow>

  <step name="Analysis & Planning" number="1">
    - **Understand the Issue**: Use `gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER` to get the full context.
      - **IF ISSUE VIEW FAILS**: Report the specific `gh` CLI error (e.g., "Failed to fetch issue details.") and **STOP**.
    - **Identify Code**: Search the codebase to locate all relevant files and modules.
    - **Formulate a Plan**: Create a clear implementation plan and post it as a comment on the GitHub issue for transparency and feedback.
      - **IF PLAN FORMULATION FAILS**: Report the specific blocker (e.g., "Unable to formulate a clear plan due to ambiguous requirements.") and **STOP**.
  </step>

  <step name="Implementation" number="2">
    - **Create Branch**: Check out a new, descriptive branch (e.g., `feat/issue-123-add-login` or `fix/issue-456-null-pointer`).
      - **IF BRANCH CREATION FAILS**: Report the specific Git error (e.g., "Failed to create branch.") and **STOP**.
    - **Write Code**: Implement the solution according to your plan, adhering to project conventions.
    - **Write Tests**: Include comprehensive tests (unit, integration) for all new functionality or bug fixes.
  </step>

  <step name="Validation" number="3">
    - **Run Quality Checks**: Execute all local validation steps, such as `make lint` and `make test`.
      - **IF LINTING FAILS**: Report "Linting failed. Please fix the issues before proceeding." and **STOP**.
      - **IF TESTING FAILS**: Report "Tests failed. Please fix the issues before proceeding." and **STOP**.
    - **Ensure All Pass**: Confirm that all existing and new tests pass successfully.
  </step>

  <step name="Delivery" number="4">
    - **Commit Changes**: Create a single, focused commit with a message following Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: Add user login via OAuth\n\nCloses #123`).
      - **IF COMMIT FAILS**: Report the specific Git error (e.g., "Failed to commit changes.") and **STOP**.
    - **Push and Create PR**: Push the branch and open a Pull Request with a clear title and a comprehensive description.
      - **IF PUSH/PR CREATION FAILS**: Report the specific error (e.g., "Failed to push branch or create PR.") and **STOP**.
    - **Enable Auto-Merge**: Use `gh pr merge --auto --squash` to enable automatic merging after CI passes.
      - **IF AUTO-MERGE FAILS**: Report the error (e.g., "Failed to enable auto-merge.") but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
  </step>

<constraints>
  - One Pull Request per issue unless specified otherwise.
  - All CI checks must pass before a PR is considered complete.
  - Never commit directly to the `main` branch.
</constraints>

<validation>
  - The Pull Request is successfully created and merged.
  - The corresponding GitHub issue is automatically closed.
