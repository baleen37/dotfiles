1. **Review the GitHub issues** and choose a small, quick-to-complete task.
2. **Plan your approach** carefully and post that plan as a comment on the chosen issue.
3. **Create a new branch** and implement your solution:
    - Write robust, well-documented code.
    - Include thorough tests and ample debug logging.
    - Ensure all tests pass before moving on.
4. **Open a pull request** once youâ€™re confident in your solution and push all changes to GitHub. Each pull request should be based on the previous branch since we haven't merged any branches into main yet
5. **Enable auto-merge and monitor CI**:
   - Enable auto-merge for the PR: `gh pr merge --auto --squash`
   - Monitor CI status: `gh pr status` or check Actions tab
   - Wait for all CI checks to complete (lint, smoke, build, smoke)

6. **Handle CI failures** (if any):
   - Review failed CI logs to identify issues
   - Fix linting errors: `make lint` locally first
   - Fix build failures: `make build` to test changes
   - Commit and push fixes to the same branch
   - Repeat until all CI checks pass

7. **Verify auto-merge completion**:
   - Confirm PR is automatically merged after CI passes
   - Check that issue is automatically closed (if linked)  
   - Pull latest main branch: `git checkout main && git pull`

8. **Keep the issue open** until your PR is merged and all CI checks pass.
