<planning_philosophy>
Core planning principles:
1. **User-Centric Value**: Every milestone must deliver measurable user value or validated learning
2. **Hypothesis-Driven**: Treat plans as testable hypotheses; pivot when data contradicts assumptions  
3. **Risk-First Thinking**: Surface and mitigate high-impact risks early in the planning process
4. **Continuous Validation**: Build feedback loops with users, stakeholders, and technical constraints
5. **Adaptive Planning**: Create flexible plans that can evolve with new information
6. **Technical Excellence**: Embed quality, security, and maintainability from the foundation
</planning_philosophy>

## Project Planning Protocol

### Phase 1: Problem Definition & User Research
<problem_discovery>
**Step 1: Clarify the Core Problem**
- [ ] Define the problem statement using this framework:
  ```
  Users: [WHO exactly faces this problem]
  Problem: [WHAT specific pain point or opportunity]  
  Context: [WHEN/WHERE does this problem occur]
  Impact: [WHY does this matter - cost, time, frustration]
  Current Solutions: [HOW do users solve this today]
  Success Metrics: [HOW will we measure improvement]
  ```

**Step 2: Stakeholder Mapping & Alignment**
- [ ] Identify all stakeholders and their relationships:
  - **Primary Users**: Those who directly use the solution
  - **Secondary Users**: Those affected by or influencing usage
  - **Decision Makers**: Those who approve, fund, or control adoption
  - **Technical Stakeholders**: Those who build, maintain, or integrate
  - **Governance**: Those who ensure compliance, security, or standards

- [ ] For each stakeholder group, document:
  - Success criteria (what victory looks like for them)
  - Concerns and objections (what could make them resist)
  - Influence level (high/medium/low impact on project success)
  - Communication needs (how often, what format, what decisions)

**Step 3: Requirements Validation**
- [ ] Validate requirements using Jobs-to-be-Done framework:
  - **Functional Job**: What task is the user trying to accomplish?
  - **Emotional Job**: How does the user want to feel when doing this?
  - **Social Job**: How does the user want to be perceived by others?

- [ ] Apply MoSCoW prioritization with validation:
  - **Must have**: Core jobs without which users won't adopt (validate with user interviews)
  - **Should have**: Important jobs that increase satisfaction (validate with user testing)
  - **Could have**: Nice-to-have jobs if time permits (validate with usage analytics)
  - **Won't have**: Explicitly out of scope (document why for future reference)

**Step 4: Early Risk & Constraint Assessment**
- [ ] Identify critical constraints that could derail the project:
  - **Timeline**: Hard deadlines that cannot move
  - **Budget**: Resource limits that cannot be exceeded  
  - **Technical**: Platform, integration, or performance requirements
  - **Regulatory**: Compliance, security, or governance requirements
  - **Team**: Skill gaps, availability, or organizational limits
</problem_discovery>

### Phase 2: Solution Design & Technology Strategy
<solution_design>
**Step 1: Solution Approach Validation**
- [ ] Design 2-3 high-level solution approaches:
  - **Build**: Custom development approach
  - **Buy**: Existing solution/SaaS approach  
  - **Integrate**: Combination/API-first approach
  - **Hybrid**: Mixed approach for different components

- [ ] For each approach, evaluate against constraints:
  - **Time to Value**: How quickly can users get benefits?
  - **Total Cost**: Development + operational + maintenance costs
  - **Risk Level**: Technical, vendor, and execution risks
  - **Control**: How much control do we retain over the solution?
  - **Scalability**: How well does it grow with demand?

**Step 2: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
- [ ] For each major technical decision, document using ADR format:
  ```
  ## ADR-001: [Component/Decision Title]

  **Context**: What forces are at play? What constraints exist?

  **Options Considered**:
  1. Option A: [Description, pros, cons]
  2. Option B: [Description, pros, cons]  
  3. Option C: [Description, pros, cons]

  **Decision**: [Chosen option and why]

  **Consequences**:
  - Positive: [What we gain]
  - Negative: [What we give up]
  - Risks: [What could go wrong and mitigation]

  **Validation**: How will we know if this decision was correct?
  ```

**Step 3: Technical Risk Assessment**
- [ ] Evaluate technical risks using this framework:
  - **Novelty Risk**: How familiar is the team with these technologies?
  - **Complexity Risk**: How complex are the integrations and interactions?
  - **Dependency Risk**: How much do we rely on external systems/services?
  - **Scale Risk**: Will the solution handle expected load and growth?
  - **Security Risk**: What are the attack vectors and compliance requirements?
  - **Performance Risk**: Will it meet latency, throughput, and UX requirements?

- [ ] For high-risk decisions, plan validation experiments:
  - **Spike**: Time-boxed investigation (1-2 days max)
  - **Prototype**: Working proof of concept (1 week max)
  - **Pilot**: Limited production test with real users (2-4 weeks)

**Step 4: Quality & Operations Strategy**
- [ ] Define non-functional requirements upfront:
  - **Observability**: Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting strategy
  - **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, audit
  - **Performance**: Response time, throughput, resource usage targets
  - **Reliability**: Uptime, disaster recovery, rollback procedures
  - **Scalability**: Growth projections and scaling approach
  - **Maintainability**: Code quality, documentation, knowledge sharing

- [ ] **CHECKPOINT** - Present solution design and technology strategy for stakeholder approval before proceeding
</solution_design>

### Phase 3: Delivery Strategy & Risk Planning
<delivery_strategy>
**Step 1: Delivery Model Selection**
- [ ] Choose appropriate delivery approach based on project characteristics:
  - **Waterfall**: Requirements are stable, technology is proven, timeline is fixed
  - **Agile/Scrum**: Requirements evolve, need frequent user feedback, flexible timeline
  - **Lean Startup**: High uncertainty, need to validate assumptions, focus on learning
  - **Hybrid**: Different phases may need different approaches

**Step 2: Learning & Validation Strategy**
- [ ] Design validation experiments for major risks and assumptions:
  - **User Validation**: How will we test with real users throughout development?
  - **Technical Validation**: How will we prove technical approaches work at scale?
  - **Business Validation**: How will we measure actual value delivery?
  - **Integration Validation**: How will we test system interactions early?

- [ ] Plan feedback loops and decision points:
  - **Daily**: Team coordination and blocker resolution
  - **Weekly**: Progress demonstration and stakeholder feedback
  - **Bi-weekly**: Retrospectives and process improvement
  - **Monthly**: Strategic review and course correction

**Step 3: Comprehensive Risk Management**
- [ ] Identify and plan for all risk categories:

  **Technical Risks**:
  - Unproven technology choices
  - Complex integrations
  - Performance and scalability unknowns
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Data migration challenges

  **Product Risks**:
  - User adoption lower than expected
  - Feature complexity exceeds user needs
  - Competitive threats emerge
  - Regulatory changes impact requirements

  **Project Risks**:
  - Key team members unavailable
  - Dependencies on external teams
  - Scope creep from stakeholders
  - Budget constraints tighten

  **Organizational Risks**:
  - Leadership priorities shift
  - Organizational restructuring
  - Compliance requirements change
  - Infrastructure dependencies

- [ ] For each high-probability or high-impact risk, document:
  ```
  Risk: [Clear description]
  Probability: [Low/Medium/High]
  Impact: [Low/Medium/High]

  Prevention: [Proactive steps to reduce likelihood]
  Detection: [Early warning signals]
  Response: [What to do if it happens]
  Owner: [Who monitors and responds]
  Review Date: [When to reassess]
  ```
</delivery_strategy>

### Phase 4: Incremental Delivery Planning
<delivery_phases>
**Step 1: Define Delivery Increments**
- [ ] Structure delivery using value-driven increments:

  **Increment 0 - Foundation** (Week 1-2)
     - **Goal**: Establish development workflow and prove deployment pipeline
     - **Key Results**:
       - Team can deploy code changes within 15 minutes
       - Basic monitoring and alerting is functional
       - Development environment matches production
     - **Deliverables**:
       - Repository with CI/CD pipeline
       - Infrastructure as code (staging + production)
       - Development environment setup documentation
       - "Hello World" application deployed and monitored

  **Increment 1 - Core User Journey** (Week 3-6)
     - **Goal**: Enable the primary user workflow end-to-end
     - **Key Results**:
       - Users can complete the core task without assistance
       - Core workflow has <2 second response time

     - **Deliverables**:
       - Advanced features based on user feedback
       - Performance optimizations
       - Enhanced security and compliance features
       - Comprehensive documentation and support

**Step 2: Validate Delivery Approach**
- [ ] For each increment, validate the approach:
  - **User Value**: Does this increment solve a complete user problem?
  - **Technical Feasibility**: Can we build this with current team and timeline?
  - **Business Viability**: Does this increment move key business metrics?
  - **Rollback Safety**: Can we safely rollback if this increment fails?

**Step 3: Plan Dependencies and Parallelization**
- [ ] Identify work that can be done in parallel:
  - **Frontend and Backend**: Can be developed simultaneously with API contracts
  - **Infrastructure and Application**: Can be built in parallel with staging environments
  - **Documentation and Features**: Can be written alongside development
  - **Testing and Integration**: Can be prepared before feature completion

- [ ] Map critical path dependencies:
  - What must be completed before other work can start?
  - Which dependencies have the highest risk of delay?
  - What can be mocked or stubbed to unblock parallel work?
</delivery_phases>

### Phase 5: Task Decomposition & Sprint Planning
<task_breakdown>
**Step 1: User Story Mapping**
- [ ] Break down increments into user stories using this hierarchy:
  ```
  Epic: [Large user goal spanning multiple increments]
  ├── Feature: [Cohesive functionality within an increment]  
  │   ├── User Story: [Single user task, 1-5 days]
  │   │   ├── Task: [Technical work item, 0.5-2 days]
  │   │   └── Subtask: [Specific implementation step, 2-4 hours]
  ```

**Step 2: Definition of Ready & Done**
- [ ] Define "Definition of Ready" for user stories:
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear and testable
  - [ ] User value and success metrics are defined
  - [ ] Dependencies are identified and available
  - [ ] Design/mockups are approved (if UI involved)
  - [ ] Technical approach is validated
  - [ ] Story is sized and fits in one sprint

- [ ] Define "Definition of Done" for all work:
  - [ ] Code is written and reviewed
  - [ ] Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage
  - [ ] Integration tests pass
  - [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - [ ] Security review completed
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] Deployed to staging and validated
  - [ ] Performance meets requirements
  - [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

**Step 3: Task Estimation & Sizing**
- [ ] Use relative sizing (T-shirt sizes or story points):
  - **XS (1 point)**: Simple change, well-understood, 2-4 hours
  - **S (2 points)**: Small feature or fix, some complexity, 0.5-1 day
  - **M (3-5 points)**: Medium feature, moderate complexity, 1-2 days
  - **L (8 points)**: Large feature, significant complexity, 3-5 days
  - **XL (13+ points)**: Epic that needs further breakdown

- [ ] Apply the "INVEST" criteria to user stories:
  - **Independent**: Can be developed and tested standalone
  - **Negotiable**: Details can be refined during development
  - **Valuable**: Delivers measurable user or business value
  - **Estimable**: Team can reasonably estimate effort
  - **Small**: Can be completed within a sprint
  - **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria

**Step 4: Sprint and Release Planning**
- [ ] Plan sprints using team velocity:
  - **Sprint 0**: Team setup, infrastructure, "Hello World" (capacity building)
  - **Sprint 1-2**: Core user journey (highest value features)
  - **Sprint 3+**: Iterative value expansion based on feedback

- [ ] For each sprint, define:
  - **Sprint Goal**: One sentence describing the sprint outcome
  - **Success Metrics**: How we measure sprint success
  - **Risk Mitigation**: What could go wrong and contingency plans
  - **Stakeholder Demo**: What we'll show and to whom
  - **Retrospective Focus**: What process improvements we'll try

**Step 5: Continuous Planning**
- [ ] Establish planning rhythms:
  - **Daily**: Sprint progress and impediment resolution
  - **Weekly**: Backlog refinement and story preparation
  - **Sprint-based**: Sprint planning, review, and retrospective
  - **Increment-based**: Release planning and strategy review
</task_breakdown>

### Phase 6: Plan Validation & Communication
<plan_validation>

  - ✓ **Resource Realism**: Is the plan achievable with available team and timeline?
  - ✓ **Risk Mitigation**: Are high-impact risks identified and addressed?
  - ✓ **Quality Integration**: Are testing, security, and compliance built in?
  - ✓ **Measurable Success**: Are success criteria objective and trackable?

**Step 2: Anti-Pattern Detection**
- [ ] Check for common planning anti-patterns:
  - ❌ **Big Bang Integration**: "We'll integrate everything at the end"
  - ❌ **Testing Afterthought**: "We'll add tests after the features work"
  - ❌ **Documentation Debt**: "We'll document everything later"
  - ❌ **Performance Surprise**: "We'll optimize when we have performance problems"
  - ❌ **Security Bolt-on**: "We'll add security before we launch"
  - ❌ **Monolithic Deliveries**: "We need to build everything before it's useful"

**Step 3: Stakeholder Alignment**
- [ ] Validate plan with key stakeholders:
  - **Users**: Will this solve their problems in the right order?
  - **Technical Team**: Is this technically feasible and maintainable?
  - **Business**: Does this deliver business value at the right pace?
  - **Operations**: Can we support and maintain this solution?
  - **Security/Compliance**: Are requirements met throughout development?

**Step 4: Communication Plan**
- [ ] Define communication strategy:
  - **Stakeholder Matrix**: Who needs what information and when?
  - **Status Reporting**: How will progress be communicated?
  - **Decision Escalation**: How will blocked decisions be resolved?
  - **Change Management**: How will scope changes be evaluated and approved?
  - **Success Celebration**: How will milestones and wins be recognized?

**Step 5: Continuous Improvement Setup**
- [ ] Establish learning and adaptation mechanisms:
  - **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into progress and health
  - **Feedback Loops**: Regular input from users, stakeholders, and team
  - **Retrospectives**: Systematic process improvement
  - **Pivot Criteria**: Clear conditions that would trigger plan changes
  - **Knowledge Capture**: Documentation of lessons learned and decisions made

### 🚨 **Red Flags to Avoid**
- ❌ Planning in isolation without stakeholder input
- ❌ Treating plans as unchangeable once written
- ❌ Skipping risk assessment or user validation
- ❌ Building everything before testing anything
- ❌ Ignoring team capacity and skill constraints
- ❌ Planning without clear success metrics

### 🎗️ **Success Indicators**
- ✅ Stakeholders can clearly explain the problem and solution
- ✅ Team feels confident about technical feasibility
- ✅ Users validate the problem and proposed solution
- ✅ Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- ✅ Success metrics are specific and measurable
- ✅ Plan has flexibility for learning and adaptation

---

🛑 **MANDATORY CHECKPOINT**: After completing the planning process, you MUST:

1. **Present Planning Results** - Show all planning phase outcomes to Jito
2. **Get Approval** - Obtain explicit approval of the plan before proceeding
3. **Recommend Next Steps** - Suggest creating formal plan document and implementation approach

**CRITICAL**: Planning phase ends with stakeholder approval. Document creation and implementation are separate follow-up activities that require explicit permission.

This ensures alignment on strategy before moving to execution and prevents building the wrong solution efficiently.
