<thinking_framework>
Before each major decision, think step-by-step:
1. What are the core requirements and constraints?
2. What are the technical and business risks?
3. What's the simplest approach that could work?
4. How can we validate assumptions early?
5. What could go wrong, and how do we mitigate it?
</thinking_framework>

## Project Planning Protocol

### Phase 0: Requirements Discovery
<requirements_gathering>
- [ ] If no specification exists, ask for:
  - **WHAT**: Core problem to solve and success metrics
  - **WHO**: Target users and their pain points  
  - **WHEN**: Timeline, milestones, and deadlines
  - **WHY**: Business value and impact
  - **CONSTRAINTS**: Budget, team size, technical limitations

- [ ] Extract and prioritize requirements using MoSCoW:
  - **Must have**: Core features without which the project fails
  - **Should have**: Important but not critical for launch
  - **Could have**: Nice-to-have if time permits
  - **Won't have**: Explicitly out of scope (this time)
</requirements_gathering>

### Phase 1: Technology Analysis
<technology_selection>
Think step-by-step about technology choices:

- [ ] For each component, evaluate options against:
  - **Fitness**: Does it solve our specific problem?
  - **Familiarity**: Team expertise and learning curve
  - **Future-proof**: Maintenance, community, longevity
  - **Feasibility**: Can we actually implement it in our timeline?

- [ ] Document each major choice with:
  ```
  Component: [Database/Framework/Service]
  Selected: [Technology name]
  Rationale: [2-3 sentences on why]
  Trade-offs: [What we're giving up]
  Alternatives considered: [Other options and why rejected]
  Risk: [Low/Medium/High] - [Mitigation strategy]
  ```

- [ ] **STOP** - Present technology choices for user approval before proceeding
</technology_selection>

### Phase 2: Architecture & Design
<architecture_planning>
- [ ] Design the system architecture:
  - Start with the simplest architecture that could possibly work
  - Identify integration points and APIs
  - Plan for observability from day one
  - Consider deployment and operations

- [ ] Apply the "Rule of Three":
  - If unsure between approaches, prototype the top 3
  - Timebox each prototype to 2-4 hours max
  - Document findings and make data-driven decision
</architecture_planning>

### Phase 3: Incremental Delivery Planning
<delivery_phases>
- [ ] Structure delivery in phases using these principles:
  1. **Phase 0 - Foundation** (Week 1-2)
     - Project setup, CI/CD, development environment
     - Basic architecture scaffolding
     - "Hello World" deployment

  2. **Phase 1 - MVP** (Week 3-X)
     - Minimum feature set that provides value
     - Must be actually usable by target users
     - Include basic observability

  3. **Phase 2+ - Iterations**
     - Each phase adds complete features
     - No phase should break existing functionality
     - Each phase should be deployable

- [ ] For each phase, define:
  - **Goal**: One sentence describing the outcome
  - **Success Criteria**: How we know it's done
  - **Dependencies**: What must be complete first
  - **Risks**: What could derail this phase
</delivery_phases>

### Phase 4: Task Decomposition
<task_breakdown>
- [ ] Break each phase into concrete tasks following these rules:
  - Each task should be 0.5-3 days of work
  - Tasks must have a clear "Definition of Done"
  - Include tasks for tests, documentation, and deployment
  - Add 20% buffer for unknowns

- [ ] Use this template for each task:
  ```
  Task ID: [PHASE-NUMBER]
  Title: [Verb + Specific Outcome]
  Size: [S(0.5d)/M(1d)/L(2d)/XL(3d)]

  Description: [What and why]

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 1
  - [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 2

  Dependencies: [Task IDs that must complete first]
  ```

- [ ] Validate task sizing:
  - Can a mid-level engineer complete this in the estimated time?
  - Is the scope crystal clear?
  - Are success criteria objective?
</task_breakdown>

### Phase 5: Risk Management
<risk_assessment>
Think about what could go wrong:

- [ ] Identify risks using categories:
  - **Technical**: Unfamiliar tech, complex integrations
  - **External**: Third-party APIs, vendor dependencies  
  - **Resource**: Team availability, skill gaps
  - **Scope**: Feature creep, changing requirements

- [ ] For each risk, document:
  ```
  Risk: [Description]
  Probability: [Low/Medium/High]
  Impact: [Low/Medium/High]
  Mitigation: [Proactive steps to prevent]
  Contingency: [What to do if it happens]
  Owner: [Who monitors this risk]
  ```

- [ ] Include "pre-mortem" thinking:
  - Imagine the project failed - what went wrong?
  - Address those failure modes in the plan
</risk_assessment>

### Phase 6: Plan Validation
<validation_checklist>
- [ ] Review the complete plan against these criteria:
  - ‚úì Does Phase 1 deliver real user value?
  - ‚úì Can we demo progress every week?
  - ‚úì Are tasks small enough to avoid surprises?
  - ‚úì Do we have clear rollback plans?
  - ‚úì Is testing built into each phase?
  - ‚úì Have we accounted for deployment and operations?

- [ ] Anti-patterns to check for:
  - ‚ùå "Build everything, then test"
  - ‚ùå "We'll figure out deployment later"
  - ‚ùå Tasks longer than 3 days
  - ‚ùå Phases with no user-visible progress
  - ‚ùå Missing documentation or observability
</validation_checklist>

### Phase 7: Final Plan Assembly
<final_output>
- [ ] Create `plan.md` with this structure:
  ```markdown
  # Project: [Name]

  ## Executive Summary
  [2-3 paragraphs: problem, solution, impact]

  ## Success Metrics
  - Metric 1: [Specific, measurable]
  - Metric 2: [Specific, measurable]

  ## Technology Stack
  [Table of components and choices with rationale]

  ## Delivery Phases

  ### Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1-2)
  **Goal**: [One sentence]
  **Deliverables**: [Bullet list]

  #### Tasks:
  1. [TASK-001] Set up development environment (1d)
     - Description: ...
     - Acceptance Criteria: ...

  ### Phase 1: MVP (Week 3-X)
  [Continue pattern...]

  ## Risk Register
  [Table of risks with mitigation plans]

  ## Open Questions
  [Decisions that need stakeholder input]
  ```
</final_output>

<critical_reminders>
‚ö†Ô∏è **REMEMBER**:
- Think step-by-step before each major decision
- Start simple, iterate toward complex
- Every phase must deliver working software
- Include tests and docs in estimates
- When in doubt, ask for clarification

üõë **STOP**: After completing the plan, ask Jito what to do next. DO NOT implement anything.
