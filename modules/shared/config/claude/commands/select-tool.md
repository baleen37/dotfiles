# /sc:select-tool - Intelligent MCP Tool Selection

## Purpose
Analyze requested operations and determine the optimal MCP tool (Serena or Morphllm) based on sophisticated complexity scoring, operation type classification, and performance requirements. This meta-system command provides intelligent routing to ensure optimal tool selection with <100ms decision time and >95% accuracy.

## Usage
```
/sc:select-tool [operation] [--analyze] [--explain] [--force serena|morphllm]
```

## Arguments
- `operation` - Description of the operation to perform and analyze
- `--analyze` - Show detailed complexity analysis and scoring breakdown
- `--explain` - Explain the selection decision with confidence metrics
- `--force serena|morphllm` - Override automatic selection for testing
- `--validate` - Validate selection against actual operation requirements
- `--dry-run` - Preview selection decision without tool activation

## Specialized Execution Flow

## Advanced Specialized Features

### Intelligent Routing Algorithm
- **Direct Operation Mapping**: symbol_operations → Serena, pattern_edits → Morphllm, memory_operations → Serena
- **Complexity-Based Selection**: score > 0.6 → Serena, score < 0.4 → Morphllm, 0.4-0.6 → feature-based
- **Feature Requirement Analysis**: needs_lsp → Serena, needs_patterns → Morphllm, needs_semantic → Serena, needs_speed → Morphllm

### Multi-Dimensional Complexity Analysis
- **File Count Scoring**: Logarithmic scaling for multi-file operations
- **Operation Type Weighting**: Refactoring > renaming > editing complexity hierarchy
- **Dependency Analysis**: Cross-file dependencies increase complexity scores
- **Language Complexity**: Framework and language-specific complexity factors

### Performance Optimization Patterns
- **Decision Caching**: Cache frequent operation patterns for instant selection
