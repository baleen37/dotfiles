# Complete Development Workflow

A comprehensive development workflow that combines planning and coding phases.

## Usage

This workflow combines the planning and implementation phases. For individual phases, use:

* **`plan.md`** - For analysis, planning, and design phases only
* **`code.md`** - For implementation and documentation phases only

## Full Workflow Steps

1. **Analysis Phase** - Use `plan.md` for codebase exploration and requirement gathering
2. **Design Phase** - Use `plan.md` for creating detailed implementation plans  
3. **Review Phase** - Use `plan.md` for plan approval and feedback
4. **Implementation Phase** - Use `code.md` for actual coding work
5. **Documentation Phase** - Use `code.md` for commits and documentation updates

## When to Use This Command

Use this complete workflow for:
- Large, complex features requiring thorough planning
- Critical system changes that need careful design review
- New projects or major refactoring efforts
