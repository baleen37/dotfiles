# /sc:load - Project Context Loading with Serena

## Purpose
Load and analyze project context using Serena MCP for project activation, memory retrieval, and context management with session lifecycle integration and cross-session persistence capabilities.

## Usage
```
/sc:load [target] [--type project|config|deps|env|checkpoint] [--refresh] [--analyze] [--checkpoint ID] [--resume] [--validate] [--performance] [--metadata] [--cleanup] [--uc]
```

## Arguments
- `target` - Project directory or name (defaults to current directory)
- `--type` - Specific loading type (project, config, deps, env, checkpoint)
- `--refresh` - Force reload of project memories and context
- `--analyze` - Run deep analysis after loading
- `--onboard` - Run onboarding if not performed
- `--checkpoint` - Restore from specific checkpoint ID
- `--resume` - Resume from latest checkpoint automatically
- `--validate` - Validate session integrity and data consistency
- `--performance` - Enable performance monitoring and optimization
- `--metadata` - Include comprehensive session metadata
- `--cleanup` - Perform session cleanup and optimization
- `--uc` - Enable Token Efficiency mode for all memory operations (optional)

## Token Efficiency Integration

### Optional Token Efficiency Mode
The `/sc:load` command supports optional Token Efficiency mode via the `--uc` flag:

- **User Choice**: `--uc` flag can be explicitly specified for compression
- **Compression Strategy**: When enabled: 30-50% reduction with ≥95% information preservation
- **Content Classification**:
  - **SuperClaude Framework** (0% compression): Complete exclusion
  - **User Project Content** (0% compression): Full fidelity preservation
  - **Session Data** (30-50% compression): Optimized storage when --uc used
- **Quality Preservation**: Framework compliance with MODE_Token_Efficiency.md patterns

### Performance Benefits (when --uc used)
- Token Efficiency applies to all session memory operations
- Compression inherited by memory operations within session context
- Performance benefits: Faster session operations and reduced context usage

## Session Lifecycle Integration

### 1. Session State Management
- Analyze current session state and context requirements
- Use `activate_project` tool to activate the project
- Pass `{"project": target}` as parameters
- Automatically handles project registration if needed
- Validates project path and language detection
- Identify critical information for persistence or restoration
- Assess session integrity and continuity needs

### 2. Serena MCP Coordination with Token Efficiency
- Execute appropriate Serena MCP operations for session management
- Call `list_memories` tool to discover existing memories
- Load relevant memories based on --type parameter:
  - **project**: Load project_purpose, tech_stack memories (framework excluded from compression)
  - **config**: Load code_style_conventions, completion_tasks (framework excluded from compression)
  - **deps**: Analyze package.json/pyproject.toml (preserve user content)
  - **env**: Load environment-specific memories (framework excluded from compression)
- **Content Classification Strategy**:
  - **SuperClaude Framework** (Complete exclusion): All framework directories and components
  - **Session Data** (Apply compression): Session metadata, checkpoints, cache content only
  - **User Project Content** (Preserve fidelity): Project files, user documentation, configurations
- Handle memory organization, checkpoint creation, or state restoration with selective compression
- Manage cross-session context preservation and enhancement with optimized storage

### 3. Performance Validation
- Monitor operation performance against strict session targets
- Read memories using `read_memory` tool with `{"memory_file_name": name}`
- Build comprehensive project context from memories
- Supplement with file analysis if memories incomplete
- Validate memory efficiency and response time requirements
- Ensure session operations meet <200ms core operation targets

### 4. Context Continuity
- Maintain session context across operations and interruptions
- Call `check_onboarding_performed` tool
- If not onboarded and --onboard flag, call `onboarding` tool
- Create initial memories if project is new
- Preserve decision history, task progress, and accumulated insights
- Enable seamless continuation of complex multi-session workflows

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Validate session data integrity and completeness
- If --checkpoint flag: Load specific checkpoint via `read_memory`
- If --resume flag: Load latest checkpoint from `checkpoints/latest`
- If --type checkpoint: Restore session state from checkpoint metadata
- Display resumption summary showing:
  - Work completed in previous session
  - Open tasks and questions
  - Context changes since checkpoint
  - Estimated time to full restoration
- Verify cross-session compatibility and version consistency
- Generate session analytics and performance reports
