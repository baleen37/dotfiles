# /design - System and Component Design

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive system architecture, API specifications, and component interfaces with best practices validation

## Usage

```bash
/design <target>             # General system design
/design api <name>           # API specification design
/design architecture <name>  # System architecture design
/design component <name>     # Component interface design
```

## Execution Strategy

- **Basic**: Requirement analysis and design specification creation
- **Architecture**: System-level design with component interactions
- **API**: RESTful API design with OpenAPI specifications
- **Component**: Interface design with clear contracts
- **Validation**: Best practices and pattern compliance

## MCP Integration

- **Sequential**: Multi-step design planning and systematic analysis
- **Context7**: Framework-specific patterns and industry best practices

## Examples

```bash
/design user authentication  # Authentication system design
/design api payment          # Payment API specification
/design architecture ecommerce # E-commerce system architecture
/design component UserProfile # Component interface design
```

## Agent Routing

- **system-architect**: Complex architectures, system design patterns, scalability considerations
