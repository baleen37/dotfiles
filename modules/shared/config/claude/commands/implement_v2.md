description: "Intelligent code implementation with multi-domain coordination and validation"
---

Implement features through coordinated analysis, design, coding, and validation with comprehensive quality assurance.

**Usage**: `/implement_v2 [feature-description]`

## Auto-Detection

- **Implementation Type**: Automatically determined from description (component, API, service, feature)
- **Framework**: Detected from existing codebase patterns
- **Security**: Built-in security best practices
- **Testing**: Generate tests when explicitly requested in description

## Implementation Flow

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Parse specifications and determine technical approach
2. **Architecture Design**: Plan component structure, data flow, and integration points
3. **Code Generation**: Write implementation following project patterns and conventions
4. **Security Validation**: Review for vulnerabilities and security best practices
5. **Quality Assurance**: Code quality, performance, and maintainability review
6. **Testing**: Generate and run comprehensive test suite
7. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing codebase

## Multi-Domain Coordination

- **Architecture**: System design and technical decisions
- **Frontend**: UI/UX implementation and user interaction
- **Backend**: Server logic, APIs, and data management
- **Security**: Vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices
- **Testing**: Test strategy and comprehensive validation

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware**: Analyzes existing codebase patterns and conventions
- **Incremental**: Builds features step-by-step with validation
- **Comprehensive**: Includes documentation, tests, and integration
- **Quality-First**: Validates security, performance, and maintainability

## Example Usage

```
/implement_v2 "User authentication with OAuth and comprehensive tests"
```

This will automatically detect it's a feature implementation, identify the Next.js framework from your codebase, apply security best practices, and generate comprehensive tests as requested.
