# /sc:reflect - Task Reflection and Validation

## Purpose
Perform comprehensive task reflection and validation using Serena MCP reflection tools, bridging traditional TodoWrite patterns with Serena's analysis capabilities for enhanced task management with session lifecycle integration and cross-session persistence capabilities.

## Usage
```
/sc:reflect [--type task|session|completion] [--analyze] [--update-session] [--validate] [--performance] [--metadata] [--cleanup]
```

## Arguments
- `--type` - Reflection type (task, session, completion)
- `--analyze` - Perform deep analysis of collected information
- `--update-session` - Update session metadata with reflection results
- `--checkpoint` - Create checkpoint after reflection if needed
- `--validate` - Validate session integrity and data consistency
- `--performance` - Enable performance monitoring and optimization
- `--metadata` - Include comprehensive session metadata
- `--cleanup` - Perform session cleanup and optimization

## Session Lifecycle Integration

### 1. Session State Management
- Analyze current session state and context requirements
- Call `think_about_task_adherence` to validate current approach
- Check if current work aligns with project goals and session objectives
- Identify any deviations from planned approach
- Generate recommendations for course correction if needed
- Identify critical information for persistence or restoration
- Assess session integrity and continuity needs

### 2. Serena MCP Coordination with Token Efficiency
- Execute appropriate Serena MCP operations for session management
- Call `think_about_collected_information` to analyze session work with selective compression
- **Content Classification for Reflection Operations**:
  - **SuperClaude Framework** (Complete exclusion): All framework directories and components
  - **Session Data** (Apply compression): Reflection metadata, analysis results, insights only
  - **User Project Content** (Preserve fidelity): Project files, user documentation, configurations
- Evaluate completeness of information gathering with optimized memory operations
- Identify gaps or missing context using compressed reflection data
- Assess quality and relevance of collected data with framework exclusion awareness
- Handle memory organization, checkpoint creation, or state restoration with selective compression
- Manage cross-session context preservation and enhancement with optimized storage

### 3. Performance Validation
- Monitor operation performance against strict session targets
- Task reflection: <4s for comprehensive analysis (improved with Token Efficiency)
- Session reflection: <8s for full information assessment (improved with selective compression)
- Completion reflection: <2.5s for validation (improved with optimized operations)
- TodoWrite integration: <800ms for status synchronization (improved with compression)
- Token Efficiency overhead: <100ms for selective compression operations
- Validate memory efficiency and response time requirements
- Ensure session operations meet <200ms core operation targets

### 4. Context Continuity
- Maintain session context across operations and interruptions
- Call `think_about_whether_you_are_done` for completion validation
- Evaluate task completion criteria against actual progress
- Identify remaining work items or blockers
- Determine if current task can be marked as complete
- Preserve decision history, task progress, and accumulated insights
- Enable seamless continuation of complex multi-session workflows

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Validate session data integrity and completeness
- Use `TodoRead` to get current task states
- Map TodoWrite tasks to Serena reflection insights
- Update task statuses based on reflection results
- Maintain compatibility with existing TodoWrite patterns
- If --update-session flag: Load current session metadata and incorporate reflection insights
- Verify cross-session compatibility and version consistency
- Generate session analytics and performance reports
