# Documentation Update Workflow

A systematic workflow for updating project documentation comprehensively.

## Step 1: Document Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze current documentation status and determine update scope.

**Prompt Example:**

> "Starting project documentation update.
> 
> Please analyze the following documents:
> - README.md
> - CHANGELOG.md  
> - API documentation
> - Technical documentation
> 
> Analysis items:
> 1. Current documentation completeness and accuracy
> 2. Missing content or outdated information
> 3. Inconsistencies between code and documentation
> 4. Update priority ranking
> 
> **Do not write any code at this stage. Provide analysis only.**"

## Step 2: Update Plan

**Objective:** Develop a detailed documentation update plan.

**Prompt Example:**

> "Based on the analysis, please create a documentation update plan.
> 
> Plan should include:
> 1. List of documents to update (by priority)
> 2. Specific update content for each document
> 3. New documents to create (if needed)
> 4. Strategy for maintaining consistency across documents
> 5. Estimated timeline and sequence
> 
> Please structure the plan in numbered steps."

## Step 3: Review & Approval

**Objective:** Review the plan and obtain approval before proceeding.

**Prompt Example:**

> "The documentation update plan is complete.
> 
> Review items:
> 1. Does the plan accurately reflect the current project state?
> 2. Are the update priorities appropriate?
> 3. Are there any missing documents or sections?
> 4. Any additions or modifications needed?
> 
> Please approve so I can begin the documentation updates."

## Step 4: Execute Updates

**Objective:** Execute documentation updates according to the approved plan.

**Prompt Example:**

> "Please update the documentation according to the approved plan.
> 
> Execution principles:
> 1. Follow the planned sequence
> 2. Verify consistency after each document update
> 3. Maintain existing structure and style
> 4. Ensure accurate information
> 5. Write user-friendly explanations
> 
> Please report progress after completing each document."

## Step 5: Validation & Finalize

**Objective:** Validate updated documentation and finalize the process.

**Prompt Example:**

> "Documentation updates are complete.
> 
> Final validation tasks:
> 1. Verify all links and references
> 2. Test code examples for functionality
> 3. Check consistency across documents
> 4. Review for typos and formatting
> 5. Assess readability from user perspective
> 
> After validation, please proceed with commit and documentation."
