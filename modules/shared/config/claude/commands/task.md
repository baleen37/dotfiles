# /sc:task - Enhanced Task Management

## Purpose
Execute complex tasks with intelligent workflow management, cross-session persistence, hierarchical task organization, and advanced orchestration capabilities.

## Usage  
```
/sc:task [action] [target]
```

## Arguments
- `action` - Task management action (create, execute, status, analytics, optimize)
- `target` - Task description, project scope, or existing task ID

## Actions
- `create` - Create new project-level task hierarchy
- `execute` - Execute task with intelligent orchestration
- `status` - View task status and progress
- `analytics` - Task performance and analytics dashboard
- `optimize` - Optimize task execution strategies
