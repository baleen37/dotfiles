# /task - Complex Task Management & Hierarchical Organization

**Purpose**: Execute complex projects with intelligent task decomposition, strategic execution modes, and cross-session persistence.

## Usage

```bash
/task [action] [target]                    # Basic task management
/task systematic [project]                 # Comprehensive detailed planning
/task agile [feature]                      # Iterative flexible approach
/task enterprise [system]                  # Governance-focused compliance
```

## Strategic Execution Modes

**Systematic Mode:**
- Comprehensive and detailed planning approach
- Deep analysis of requirements and dependencies
- Structured implementation roadmap
- Ideal for: Complex systems, architectural changes

**Agile Mode:**
- Iterative and flexible development approach
- Parallel task execution when possible
- Quick feedback loops and adaptation
- Ideal for: Feature development, rapid prototyping

**Enterprise Mode:**
- Governance-focused approach
- Compliance and validation emphasis
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Ideal for: Enterprise systems, security-critical projects

## Hierarchical Task Organization

**Task Breakdown Structure:**
```
Epic → Feature → Story → Task → Subtask
```

**Automatic Decomposition:**
- Complex projects broken into manageable components
- Dependencies mapped and prioritized
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Progress tracking at each level

## Cross-Session Persistence

**State Management:**
- Task context preserved across sessions
- Progress continuation from previous work
- Historical decision tracking
- Learning from previous implementations

## Integration Features

**TodoWrite Coordination:**
- Seamless integration with Claude Code task tracking
- Real-time progress updates
- Task state synchronization

**MCP Server Routing:**
- Context7: Framework documentation and best practices
- Sequential: Complex multi-step planning
- Serena: Code analysis and implementation

## Examples

```bash
/task systematic authentication-system     # Comprehensive auth implementation
/task agile user-dashboard                 # Iterative dashboard development
/task enterprise compliance-audit          # Governance-focused audit system
/task breakdown microservices-platform     # Hierarchical project decomposition
```

## Success Metrics

**Quality Assurance:**
- Comprehensive task completion tracking
- Cross-session state preservation
- Intelligent predictive planning
- Strategic approach selection based on context
