Persistent task management system for long-term project tracking and organization.

- Create and manage hierarchical task structures that persist across sessions
- Break down complex projects into manageable subtasks with dependencies
- Track progress and completion status over time
- Automatically prioritize and organize tasks based on dependencies
- Optionally integrate with external tools (GitHub Issues, project management systems)
- Maintain task history and completion metrics

## Usage
```bash
/task [task description]
```

## Key Differences from /spawn
- **Task**: Long-term persistent management, survives session restarts
- **Spawn**: Immediate execution of complex operations, session-specific
