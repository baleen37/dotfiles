<objective>
To create a high-quality Pull Request for the current feature branch.
</objective>

<workflow>
<step name="pre_check" number="1">
- [ ] Ensure the current branch is up-to-date with the target branch (usually `main`) by merging or rebasing. Proactively resolve any conflicts.
- [ ] Run all local validation steps (lint, tests) one last time to ensure everything passes.
- [ ] Use `git status` to ensure there are no untracked or uncommitted changes.
</step>

<step name="creation" number="2">
- [ ] Execute `gh pr create` to initiate the process.
- [ ] **Title:** Create a title that follows the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`). The title should be clear and concise.
- [ ] **Body:** Write a comprehensive description that includes:
    - **Summary:** What is the purpose of this PR?
    - **Changes:** A high-level overview of the changes made.
    - **Testing:** How were these changes tested?
    - **Related Issues:** Link any issues that this PR resolves (e.g., `Closes #123`).
</step>

<step name="post_creation" number="3">
- [ ] Assign reviewers to the PR.
- [ ] Add appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `needs-review`).
- [ ] If the CI/CD pipeline supports it, enable auto-merge (`gh pr merge --auto --squash`).
- [ ] Announce the PR in the relevant communication channel if that is part of the team's workflow.
</step>
</workflow>

<constraints>
- The PR title and commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification.
- The PR body must not be empty and should provide sufficient context for reviewers.
- Always link to the issue(s) being addressed.
</constraints>

<validation>
- The Pull Request is successfully created on GitHub.
- The PR is linked to the correct issue.
- CI checks are triggered and running.
</validation>
