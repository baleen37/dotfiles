<objective>
  To create a high-quality, review-ready Pull Request for the current feature branch that adheres to project standards.
</objective>

<workflow>

  <step name="Pre-PR Checks" number="1">
    - **Sync Branch**: Ensure the current branch is up-to-date with the target branch (usually `main`) by merging or rebasing to prevent conflicts.
    - **Local Validation**: Run all local quality checks (`make lint`, `make test`) one last time to ensure everything passes.
    - **Check Status**: Use `git status` to confirm there are no uncommitted or untracked files.
  </step>

  <step name="PR Creation" number="2">
    - **Initiate**: Execute `gh pr create` to begin the process.
    - **Title**: Write a title that follows the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`). It must be clear and concise.
    - **Body**: Write a comprehensive description using the PR template, including:
      - **Summary**: What is the purpose of this PR and why is it needed?
      - **Changes**: A high-level overview of the technical changes.
      - **Testing**: How were these changes tested?
      - **Related Issues**: Link any issues this PR resolves (e.g., `Closes #123`).
  </step>

  <step name="Post-Creation Actions" number="3">
    - **Assign Reviewers**: Assign at least one relevant reviewer to the PR.
    - **Add Labels**: Add appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `needs-review`).
    - **Enable Auto-Merge**: If the CI/CD pipeline is robust, enable auto-merge with `gh pr merge --auto --squash`.
  </step>

</workflow>

<constraints>
  - The PR title **must** follow the Conventional Commits specification.
  - The PR body **must not** be empty and must provide sufficient context.
  - **Always** link to the issue(s) being addressed.
</constraints>

<validation>
  - The Pull Request is successfully created on GitHub.
  - The PR is correctly linked to the corresponding issue.
  - All required CI checks are triggered and running.
