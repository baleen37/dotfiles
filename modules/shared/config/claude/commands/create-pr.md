<objective>
  To create a high-quality, review-ready Pull Request for the current feature branch that adheres to project standards.
</objective>

<steps>

  <step name="Pre-PR Checks" number="1">
    - **Sync Branch**: Ensure the current branch is up-to-date with the target branch (usually `main`) by merging or rebasing to prevent conflicts.
      - **IF SYNC FAILS**: Report the specific Git error (e.g., "Merge/rebase failed due to conflicts.") and **STOP**.
    - **Local Validation**: Identify and run all relevant local quality checks (e.g., linting, testing, type checking) based on project configuration (e.g., `package.json` scripts, `Makefile` targets).
      - **IF VALIDATION FAILS**: Report the specific failure (e.g., "Linting failed. Please fix the issues before proceeding.") and **STOP**.
    - **Check Status**: Use `git status` to confirm there are no uncommitted or untracked files.
      - **IF UNCLEAN**: Report "Working directory is not clean. Please commit or stash changes." and **STOP**.
  </step>

  <step name="PR Creation" number="2">
    - **Initiate**: Execute `gh pr create` to begin the process.
      - **IF GH PR CREATE FAILS**: Report the specific `gh` CLI error (e.g., "Failed to create PR. Check GitHub authentication.") and **STOP**.
    - **Title**: Automatically generate a title following the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`) based on recent commit messages and changes. It must be clear and concise.
    - **Body**: Automatically generate a comprehensive description by filling in the project's PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`). Analyze commit messages, changed files, and the overall purpose of the branch to populate sections like "Summary", "Changes", "Testing", and "Related Issues" (linking with `Closes #123` syntax).
    - **Labels & Assignees**: Suggest appropriate labels and assignees based on the nature of the changes, affected files, and project ownership. Confirm with the user before applying.
  </step>

  <step name="Post-Creation Actions" number="3">
    - **Assign Reviewers**: Assign at least one relevant reviewer to the PR. Confirm with the user.
      - **IF ASSIGNMENT FAILS**: Report the error (e.g., "Failed to assign reviewer.") but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
    - **Add Labels**: Add appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `needs-review`). Confirm with the user.
      - **IF LABELING FAILS**: Report the error (e.g., "Failed to add labels.") but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
    - **Enable Auto-Merge (if applicable)**: If the project's contribution guidelines (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`) or user explicitly allow, enable auto-merge with `gh pr merge --auto --squash` or similar command based on project's merge strategy.
      - **IF AUTO-MERGE FAILS**: Report the error (e.g., "Failed to enable auto-merge. Check repository settings.") but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
    - **CI Monitoring**: Monitor the initial CI run to catch any immediate failures.
      - **IF CI FAILS IMMEDIATELY**: Report "CI checks failed immediately. Please review and fix the issues." but **CONTINUE**.
  </step>
