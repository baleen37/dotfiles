## Orchestration Framework

### Phase 1: Intelligent Decomposition
1. **Operation Analysis**: Parse complex requirements and success criteria
2. **Domain Identification**: Identify required specializations and expertise
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Map interdependencies and execution constraints
4. **Agent Assignment**: Select optimal agents for each subdomain
5. **Coordination Planning**: Design execution strategy and communication patterns

### Phase 2: Agent Deployment & Coordination
1. **Agent Initialization**: Deploy specialized agents with clear mandates
2. **Communication Setup**: Establish inter-agent communication and data sharing
3. **Resource Allocation**: Distribute computational and tool resources
4. **Synchronization Points**: Define coordination checkpoints and validation gates
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Establish protocols for conflicting recommendations

### Phase 3: Coordinated Execution
1. **Parallel Execution**: Execute independent operations simultaneously
2. **Real-Time Coordination**: Continuous communication and progress synchronization
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjust strategy based on intermediate results
4. **Quality Monitoring**: Continuous validation and quality assessment
5. **Progress Integration**: Synthesize results from all agents

### Phase 4: Integration & Validation
1. **Result Synthesis**: Integrate findings and deliverables from all agents
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve any conflicting recommendations or implementations
3. **Comprehensive Validation**: End-to-end testing and quality verification
4. **Documentation Generation**: Create comprehensive execution report
