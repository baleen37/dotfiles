Immediately decompose and execute complex operations using specialized agents.

- Instantly break down complex tasks into coordinated subtasks
- Execute operations in parallel using appropriate specialized agents
- Real-time coordination and result integration within current session
- Optimize execution order and resource allocation automatically
- Complete entire workflow from start to finish in one session
- Best for complex operations that need immediate completion

## Usage
```bash
/spawn [complex task description]
```

## Key Differences from /task
- **Spawn**: Immediate execution with specialized agents, session-specific
- **Task**: Long-term persistent management, survives session restarts
