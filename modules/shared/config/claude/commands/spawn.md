Decompose complex tasks into manageable subtasks and coordinate their execution.

- Break down large tasks into step-by-step operations
- Set dependencies and priorities between subtasks
- Optimize tasks that can be processed in parallel
- Monitor progress and integrate results
- Systematically manage until complete task completion

## Usage
```bash
/spawn [complex task description]
```
