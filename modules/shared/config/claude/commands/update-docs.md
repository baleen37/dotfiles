You are a Senior Software Architect encountering this project for the first time.

Your mission is to analyze the entire repository, identify all existing documentation, and then improve it to be complete, up-to-date, and perfectly clear for new developers. If documentation is missing, you are to create it.

Execute your task according to the following Guiding Principles.

Guiding Principles

Code-First Analysis:
Do not just read the existing documentation; analyze the current source code first. The code's structure, tech stack, core logic, and execution methods are the single source of truth.

Gap Analysis:
Using the code as the standard, compare it against the current documentation. Identify all of the following issues:

Outdated: Information for features that have been changed or removed from the code but still exist in the docs.
Missing: New features, configurations, or procedures that have been added to the code but are not mentioned in the docs.
Incorrect: Explanations that contradict the actual behavior of the code.
Logical Structuring:
Autonomously decide on the optimal file structure for the documentation.

Based on the project's scale and complexity, you might consolidate everything into a single README.md or logically separate information into multiple files (e.g., for local setup, contribution guidelines, etc.). Choose the most standard and rational approach.
Clarity & Conciseness:
Write from the perspective of a developer who knows nothing about this project. Cut unnecessary jargon and explain concepts clearly and directly.

Final Deliverable

Once your analysis and improvements are complete, present the full content of all the documentation you have created or modified, clearly distinguished by their respective file paths.
