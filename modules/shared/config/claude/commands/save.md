# /sc:save - Session Context Persistence

## Purpose
Save session context, progress, and discoveries to Serena MCP memories, complementing the /sc:load workflow for continuous project understanding with comprehensive session lifecycle management and cross-session persistence capabilities.

## Usage
```
/sc:save [--type session|learnings|context|all] [--summarize] [--checkpoint] [--validate] [--performance] [--metadata] [--cleanup] [--uc]
```

## Arguments
- `--type` - What to save (session, learnings, context, all)
- `--summarize` - Generate session summary using Serena's summarize_changes
- `--checkpoint` - Create a session checkpoint for recovery
- `--prune` - Remove outdated or redundant memories
- `--validate` - Validate session integrity and data consistency
- `--performance` - Enable performance monitoring and optimization
- `--metadata` - Include comprehensive session metadata
- `--cleanup` - Perform session cleanup and optimization
- `--uc` - Enable Token Efficiency mode for all memory operations (optional)

## Token Efficiency Integration

### Optional Token Efficiency Mode
The `/sc:save` command supports optional Token Efficiency mode via the `--uc` flag:

- **User Choice**: `--uc` flag can be explicitly specified for compression
- **Compression Strategy**: When enabled: 30-50% reduction with ≥95% information preservation
- **Content Classification**:
  - **SuperClaude Framework** (0% compression): Complete exclusion
  - **User Project Content** (0% compression): Full fidelity preservation
  - **Session Data** (30-50% compression): Optimized storage when --uc used
- **Quality Preservation**: Framework compliance with MODE_Token_Efficiency.md patterns

### Session Persistence Benefits (when --uc used)
- **Optimized Storage**: Session data compressed for efficient persistence
- **Faster Restoration**: Reduced memory footprint enables faster session loading
- **Context Preservation**: ≥95% information fidelity maintained across sessions
- **Performance Improvement**: 30-50% reduction in session data storage requirements

## Session Lifecycle Integration

### 1. Session State Management
- Analyze current session state and context requirements
- Call `think_about_collected_information` to analyze session work
- Identify new discoveries, patterns, and insights
- Determine what should be persisted
- Identify critical information for persistence or restoration
- Assess session integrity and continuity needs

### 2. Serena MCP Coordination with Token Efficiency
- Execute appropriate Serena MCP operations for session management
- Call `list_memories` to check existing memories
- Identify which memories need updates with selective compression
- **Content Classification Strategy**:
  - **SuperClaude Framework** (Complete exclusion): All framework directories and components
  - **Session Data** (Apply compression): Session metadata, checkpoints, cache content only
  - **User Project Content** (Preserve fidelity): Project files, user documentation, configurations
- Organize new information by category:
  - **session_context**: Current work and progress (compressed)
  - **code_patterns**: Discovered patterns and conventions (compressed)
  - **project_insights**: New understanding about the project (compressed)
  - **technical_decisions**: Architecture and design choices (compressed)
- Handle memory organization, checkpoint creation, or state restoration with selective compression
- Manage cross-session context preservation and enhancement with optimized storage

### 3. Performance Validation
- Monitor operation performance against strict session targets
- Record operation timings in session metadata
- Compare against PRD performance targets (Enhanced with Token Efficiency):
  - Memory operations: <150ms (improved from <200ms with compression)
  - Session save: <1.5s total (improved from <2s with selective compression)
  - Tool selection: <100ms
  - Compression overhead: <50ms additional processing time
- Generate performance alerts if thresholds exceeded
- Update performance_metrics memory with trending data
- Validate memory efficiency and response time requirements
- Ensure session operations meet <200ms core operation targets

### 4. Context Continuity
- Maintain session context across operations and interruptions
- Based on --type parameter:
  - **session**: Save current session work and progress using `write_memory` with key "session/{timestamp}"
  - **learnings**: Save new discoveries and insights, update existing knowledge memories
  - **context**: Save enhanced project understanding, update project_purpose, tech_stack, etc.
  - **all**: Comprehensive save of all categories
- Preserve decision history, task progress, and accumulated insights
- Enable seamless continuation of complex multi-session workflows

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Validate session data integrity and completeness
- Check if any automatic triggers are met:
  - Time elapsed ≥30 minutes since last checkpoint
  - High priority task completed (via TodoRead check)
  - High risk operation pending or completed
  - Error recovery performed
- Create checkpoint if triggered or --checkpoint flag provided
- Include comprehensive restoration data with current task states, open questions, context needed for resumption, and performance metrics snapshot
- Verify cross-session compatibility and version consistency
- Generate session analytics and performance reports
