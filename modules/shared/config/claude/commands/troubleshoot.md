# /troubleshoot [issue]

Diagnose and resolve issues in code, builds, or system behavior.

## Purpose
Systematic issue diagnosis and resolution with structured problem-solving approach.

## Usage
```bash
/troubleshoot "build failing with memory error"
/troubleshoot "API response times slow"
/troubleshoot "authentication not working"
```

## Execution Process

### 1. Analyze Issue Description
- Parse problem statement and context
- Identify issue category and potential scope
- Gather initial information about symptoms

### 2. Identify Potential Root Causes
- Examine logs and error messages
- Check recent changes and deployments
- Review system resources and configuration
- Analyze code patterns and dependencies

### 3. Execute Debugging
- Run diagnostic commands and tests
- Isolate problematic components
- Trace execution paths and data flow
- Validate assumptions with evidence

### 4. Propose Solutions
- Design targeted fixes for root causes
- Evaluate solution options and trade-offs
- Plan implementation steps and rollback strategy
- Consider impact on other system components

### 5. Apply and Verify Fixes
- Implement solutions safely
- Test fixes thoroughly
- Monitor system behavior post-fix
- Document resolution and lessons learned

## Integration Tools
- **Read**: Log analysis and code inspection
- **Bash**: Runtime diagnostics and system commands
- **Grep**: Pattern detection and log searching
- **Edit**: Implementing fixes and configuration changes

## Best Practices
- Focus on root causes, not just symptoms
- Document findings and solutions
- Test fixes before full deployment
- Consider prevention measures for future
