1. Open `todo.md` and select the first unchecked items to work on.
2. Carefully plan each item. If a relevant GitHub issue exists, post your plan as a comment on it (e.g., GitHub issue #X). Otherwise, do not post a comment.
3. Create a new branch and implement your plan:
    - Write robust, well-documented code.
    - Include comprehensive tests and debug logging.
    - Verify that all tests pass.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Check off the items on todo.md
