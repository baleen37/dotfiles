</persona>

<objective>
Execute todo items from todo.md through a structured workflow that ensures quality delivery.
Transform todo items into working, tested, and documented code changes.
Maintain accountability through proper issue tracking and pull request workflows.
</objective>

<workflow>
<step name="selection">
- [ ] Open `todo.md` file
- [ ] Identify first unchecked items to work on
- [ ] Assess complexity and dependencies
- [ ] Group related items if beneficial
- [ ] Select manageable scope for current session
</step>

<step name="planning">
- [ ] Analyze requirements for selected items
- [ ] Break down into specific implementation tasks
- [ ] Identify files and components to modify
- [ ] Plan testing approach
- [ ] Create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Post plan as comment on related GitHub issue
</step>

<step name="implementation">
- [ ] Create new feature branch with descriptive name
- [ ] Implement planned changes systematically
- [ ] Write robust, well-documented code
- [ ] Include comprehensive tests for new functionality
- [ ] Add debug logging where appropriate
- [ ] Follow existing code patterns and conventions
</step>

<step name="validation">
- [ ] Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Verify new tests pass
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Validate that implementation meets requirements
- [ ] Review code quality and documentation
</step>

<step name="delivery">

## Implementation Plan for: [Todo Item Description]

### Scope
- [ ] Todo item 1: [specific description]
- [ ] Todo item 2: [specific description]

### Approach
**Files to modify:**
- `path/to/file1.js` - [what changes]
- `path/to/file2.py` - [what changes]

**Implementation strategy:**
1. [Step 1 with rationale]
2. [Step 2 with rationale]
3. [Step 3 with rationale]

**Testing strategy:**
- Unit tests for [specific functionality]
- Integration tests for [specific workflows]
- Edge case testing for [specific scenarios]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Estimated effort:** [time estimate]
**Dependencies:** [any blockers or prerequisites]
```

<implementation_guidelines>
<code_quality>
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Use consistent error handling approaches
- Implement proper input validation
</code_quality>

<testing_requirements>
- Write unit tests for all new functions/methods
- Add integration tests for new workflows
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Ensure tests are fast and reliable
- Maintain or improve code coverage
</testing_requirements>

<documentation_standards>
- Update relevant README files
- Add inline code documentation
- Document API changes or new endpoints
- Update configuration examples if needed
- Include troubleshooting notes for complex features
</documentation_standards>
</implementation_guidelines>

<branch_naming>
Use descriptive branch names:
- `feat/todo-item-description`
- `fix/todo-bug-description`
- `refactor/todo-improvement-description`
- `docs/todo-documentation-update`

Keep names concise but descriptive (< 50 characters).
</branch_naming>

<commit_strategy>
Create focused commits for each logical change:
- `feat: implement user authentication for todo item #X`
- `test: add comprehensive tests for todo feature Y`
- `docs: update README for new todo functionality`
- `refactor: improve error handling in todo module`

Reference todo items and issues in commit messages.
</commit_strategy>

<validation_checklist>
Before marking todo items complete:
‚úì Implementation matches planned approach
‚úì All tests pass (existing + new)
‚úì Code review checklist satisfied
‚úì Documentation updated
‚úì PR properly references issues
‚úì Todo.md updated with completion status
</validation_checklist>

<error_handling>
<implementation_blockers>
If blocked during implementation:
- Document specific blocker in issue comments
- Seek clarification on requirements
- Research alternative approaches
- Ask for help with specific technical questions
</implementation_blockers>

<test_failures>
If tests fail:
- Investigate root cause systematically
- Fix implementation rather than changing tests
- Ensure tests cover actual requirements
- Add additional tests if gaps discovered
</test_failures>

<scope_changes>
If todo scope changes during implementation:
- Update plan in issue comments
- Confirm changes with stakeholders
- Adjust timeline estimates accordingly
- Document rationale for changes
</scope_changes>
</error_handling>

<critical_reminders>
‚ö†Ô∏è **REMEMBER**:
- Plan thoroughly before implementing
- Quality over speed
- Test comprehensively
- Document changes properly
- Keep stakeholders informed

üõë **STOP**: If todo requirements are unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
