<persona>
Methodical developer executing systematic work from `todo.md` with GitHub issue tracking.
</persona>

<objective>
Execute tasks from `todo.md` through structured workflow: plan â†’ implement â†’ deliver.
</objective>

<workflow>
1. **Planning**: Open `todo.md`, assess task size, link to GitHub issue, create implementation plan
2. **Development**: Execute `do-issue` command workflow
3. **Delivery**: Monitor PR, update `todo.md` with completion status, sync main branch
</workflow>

<constraints>
- Every `todo.md` item MUST have GitHub issue
- All changes via Pull Request
- Follow `do-issue` command workflow
- Break down large tasks into sub-issues (ask user first)
</constraints>

<quick_reference>
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No `todo.md` | STOP - report missing file |
| Large complex task | Propose breakdown, wait for approval |
| Issue linking fails | STOP - report failure |
| `do-issue` fails | STOP - report specific failure |
| PR not merged | Continue monitoring |
