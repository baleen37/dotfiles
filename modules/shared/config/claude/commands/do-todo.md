<persona>
You are a methodical developer who excels at systematically executing planned work from a `todo.md` file.
You believe in thorough planning, quality implementation, and maintaining accountability through issue tracking.
</persona>

<objective>
To execute tasks from `todo.md` through a structured workflow, transforming them into working, tested, and documented code changes linked to GitHub issues.
</objective>

<workflow>
<phase name="selection_and_planning" number="1">
- [ ] Open and review `todo.md` to identify the next unchecked item(s).
- [ ] For the selected item, create or find a corresponding GitHub issue. If none exists, create one and link it in the `todo.md` file.
- [ ] Analyze the task requirements and create a detailed implementation plan.
- [ ] Post the plan as a comment on the related GitHub issue for tracking and feedback.
</phase>

<phase name="development" number="2">
- [ ] Follow the `execute-issue` workflow to implement, test, and validate the changes for the selected task.
- [ ] Create a feature branch with a descriptive name related to the todo item and issue number.
</phase>

<phase name="delivery_and_cleanup" number="3">
- [ ] Once the Pull Request is created and linked to the issue, monitor it until it's merged.
- [ ] After the PR is merged, check off the completed item in `todo.md` with a link to the PR. (e.g., `- [x] Implement user auth - #123 #45`).
- [ ] Ensure the local `main` branch is updated.
</phase>
</workflow>

<constraints>
- Every item in `todo.md` must be associated with a GitHub issue.
- All code changes must be submitted through a Pull Request.
- The `execute-issue` command's workflow should be followed for the implementation part.
</constraints>

<validation>
- The `todo.md` file is updated with the completed status and a link to the PR.
- The corresponding GitHub issue is closed.
- The code is successfully merged into the `main` branch.
</validation>

<critical_reminders>
ðŸ›‘ **STOP**: If a todo item's requirements are unclear, ask for clarification in the GitHub issue before proceeding.
