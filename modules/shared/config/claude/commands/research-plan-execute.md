<objective>
To orchestrate a comprehensive research → planning → execution workflow using specialized agents, ensuring each phase builds upon the previous one with maximum thoroughness and strategic insight.
</objective>

<workflow>
  <step name="Context Analysis & Task Decomposition" number="0">
    - **Project Context Analysis** (2-3 key bullets):
      - Domain and technical requirements
      - Technology stack and platforms involved
      - Complexity level and scope
      - Key challenges and constraints
      - Performance, security, and scalability requirements

    - **Task Decomposition**: Break down the project into granular, assignable tasks:
      - Research tasks (domain analysis, tech evaluation, competitive research)
      - Planning tasks (architecture design, milestone planning, risk assessment)
      - Implementation tasks (frontend, backend, infrastructure, testing)
      - Review tasks (code review, security audit, performance optimization)

    - **Real-Time Subagent Ecosystem Discovery**:
      - **Live Subagent Survey**: Query and analyze the current subagent ecosystem dynamically
      - **Capability Profiling**: Extract each subagent's specialized skills, tools, and domain expertise
      - **Contextual Intelligence**: Analyze project requirements against discovered subagent capabilities
      - **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Use reasoning to match optimal subagents to specific tasks:
        - Prioritize exact specialty matches (e.g., `frontend-developer` for UI tasks)
        - Consider cross-domain capabilities (e.g., `security-auditor` for auth components)
        - Evaluate complexity appropriateness (specialist vs general-purpose)
        - Account for workload distribution and parallel execution opportunities

    - **Dynamic Assignment Matrix Generation**:
      - **Intelligent Task-Subagent Pairing**: Create optimized assignments based on real-time analysis:
        ```
        RESEARCH DOMAIN → Best Available Specialist → Fallback Strategy
        PLANNING AREA → Optimal Subagent Match → Alternative Options  
        IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENT → Perfect Fit Subagent → Backup Plan
        ```
      - **Adaptive Selection Logic**: Continuously optimize assignments as new subagents become available
      - **Gap Analysis**: Identify areas where no specialist exists and enhance general-purpose prompts
      - **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks efficiently across available subagent capabilities

    - **Execution Strategy Planning**: Define task dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and coordination points
    - **Quality Gates**: Establish verification points and success criteria tailored to selected subagents
  </step>

  <step name="Research Phase Orchestration" number="1">
    - **Execute Subagent Assignments**: Deploy subagents based on the assignment matrix from Step 0:
      ```
      For each research task:
      Task(description="[specific research task]", prompt="[detailed task-specific prompt based on context analysis]", subagent_type="[subagent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Parallel Research Execution**: Launch multiple research subagents concurrently when tasks are independent

    - **Research Coordination**: Monitor progress and ensure comprehensive coverage of all research areas

    - **Quality Validation**: Verify research outputs meet the quality gates established in Step 0

    - **Research Synthesis**: Compile findings into structured research document with actionable insights
  </step>

  <step name="Planning Phase Orchestration" number="2">
    - **Execute Planning Assignments**: Deploy planning subagents based on the assignment matrix:
      ```
      For each planning task:
      Task(description="[specific planning task]", prompt="Based on research findings: [research summary], [detailed planning instructions]", subagent_type="[subagent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Contextual Planning Subagent Selection**: Apply smart matching from initial discovery phase:
      - Leverage pre-analyzed subagent capabilities from Step 0
      - Apply contextual intelligence to select optimal planners for each domain
      - Use established fallback strategies when specialists unavailable
      - Document selection rationale and capability alignment

    - **Planning Coordination**: Ensure all planning outputs are compatible and well-integrated

    - **Quality Validation**: Verify planning outputs meet established quality gates

    - **Comprehensive Project Plan**: Synthesize all planning outputs into unified project roadmap
  </step>

  <step name="Execution Phase Orchestration" number="3">
    - **Execute Implementation Assignments**: Deploy execution subagents based on the assignment matrix:
      ```
      For each implementation task:
      Task(description="[specific implementation task]", prompt="Implement [feature/component] following the project plan. [detailed implementation instructions]", subagent_type="[subagent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Optimized Implementation Subagent Deployment**: Execute pre-computed assignments from initial analysis:
      - Deploy subagents based on smart matching algorithm results from Step 0
      - Apply load balancing strategy for parallel execution opportunities
      - Use enhanced domain prompts for general-purpose agents when specialists unavailable
      - Monitor subagent performance and adapt assignments if needed

    - **Parallel Execution Management**: Coordinate multiple subagents working concurrently on independent tasks

    - **Progress Monitoring**: Track implementation progress against quality gates and milestones

    - **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Ensure integration points between different implementation streams
  </step>

  <step name="Integration and Review Orchestration" number="4">
    - **Execute Review Assignments**: Deploy review subagents based on the assignment matrix:
      ```
      For each review task:
      Task(description="[specific review task]", prompt="Review [component/area] for [quality criteria]. Provide detailed feedback and improvement suggestions.", subagent_type="[subagent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Dynamic Review Subagent Selection**: Analyze available subagents and match to review needs:
      - Identify current review and validation specialists in subagent ecosystem
      - Match subagent expertise to specific review requirements (quality, security, performance, etc.)
      - Select optimal reviewer for each component/domain
      - Use general-purpose with specialized review prompts when no specialist available
