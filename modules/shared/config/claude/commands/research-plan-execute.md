<objective>
To orchestrate a comprehensive research → planning → execution workflow using specialized agents, ensuring each phase builds upon the previous one with maximum thoroughness and strategic insight.
</objective>

<workflow>
  <step name="Context Analysis & Task Decomposition" number="0">
    - **Project Context Analysis** (2-3 key bullets):
      - Domain and technical requirements
      - Technology stack and platforms involved
      - Complexity level and scope
      - Key challenges and constraints
      - Performance, security, and scalability requirements

    - **Task Decomposition**: Break down the project into granular, assignable tasks:
      - Research tasks (domain analysis, tech evaluation, competitive research)
      - Planning tasks (architecture design, milestone planning, risk assessment)
      - Implementation tasks (frontend, backend, infrastructure, testing)
      - Review tasks (code review, security audit, performance optimization)

    - **Dynamic Agent Discovery & Assignment Matrix**:
      - **Agent Ecosystem Survey**: Analyze all currently available agents and their capabilities
      - **Intelligent Matching**: Match discovered agent specializations to project tasks
      - **Create Assignment Matrix**: Generate explicit task-to-agent mappings:
        ```
        TASK: [specific task description] → AGENT: [dynamically selected optimal agent]
        ```
      - **Adaptive Selection**: Prioritize specialists, adapt to general-purpose when needed
      - **Future-Proof Design**: System adapts automatically to agent ecosystem changes

    - **Execution Order Planning**: Define task dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
    - **Quality Gates**: Establish verification points and success criteria for each task
  </step>

  <step name="Research Phase Orchestration" number="1">
    - **Execute Agent Assignments**: Deploy agents based on the assignment matrix from Step 0:
      ```
      For each research task:
      Task(description="[specific research task]", prompt="[detailed task-specific prompt based on context analysis]", subagent_type="[agent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Parallel Research Execution**: Launch multiple research agents concurrently when tasks are independent

    - **Research Coordination**: Monitor progress and ensure comprehensive coverage of all research areas

    - **Quality Validation**: Verify research outputs meet the quality gates established in Step 0

    - **Research Synthesis**: Compile findings into structured research document with actionable insights
  </step>

  <step name="Planning Phase Orchestration" number="2">
    - **Execute Planning Assignments**: Deploy planning agents based on the assignment matrix:
      ```
      For each planning task:
      Task(description="[specific planning task]", prompt="Based on research findings: [research summary], [detailed planning instructions]", subagent_type="[agent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Dynamic Planning Agent Selection**: Analyze available agents and match to planning needs:
      - Evaluate current agent capabilities against planning requirements
      - Select most appropriate specialist or fallback to general-purpose
      - Document selection rationale for each planning area

    - **Planning Coordination**: Ensure all planning outputs are compatible and well-integrated

    - **Quality Validation**: Verify planning outputs meet established quality gates

    - **Comprehensive Project Plan**: Synthesize all planning outputs into unified project roadmap
  </step>

  <step name="Execution Phase Orchestration" number="3">
    - **Execute Implementation Assignments**: Deploy execution agents based on the assignment matrix:
      ```
      For each implementation task:
      Task(description="[specific implementation task]", prompt="Implement [feature/component] following the project plan. [detailed implementation instructions]", subagent_type="[agent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Dynamic Implementation Agent Selection**: Analyze available agents and match to implementation needs:
      - Survey current agent ecosystem for relevant specializations
      - Match agent capabilities to specific implementation requirements
      - Prioritize specialists, fallback to general-purpose with enhanced domain prompts
      - Document agent selection decisions and capability gaps

    - **Parallel Execution Management**: Coordinate multiple agents working concurrently on independent tasks

    - **Progress Monitoring**: Track implementation progress against quality gates and milestones

    - **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Ensure integration points between different implementation streams
  </step>

  <step name="Integration and Review Orchestration" number="4">
    - **Execute Review Assignments**: Deploy review agents based on the assignment matrix:
      ```
      For each review task:
      Task(description="[specific review task]", prompt="Review [component/area] for [quality criteria]. Provide detailed feedback and improvement suggestions.", subagent_type="[agent from assignment matrix]")
      ```

    - **Dynamic Review Agent Selection**: Analyze available agents and match to review needs:
      - Identify current review and validation specialists in agent ecosystem
      - Match agent expertise to specific review requirements (quality, security, performance, etc.)
      - Select optimal reviewer for each component/domain
      - Use general-purpose with specialized review prompts when no specialist available

    - **Cross-Validation**: Ensure all implementation outputs meet established quality gates

    - **Integration Verification**: Validate that all components work together seamlessly

    - **Final Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation against original project objectives

    - **Orchestration Post-mortem**: Analyze agent selection effectiveness and coordination efficiency
  </step>
