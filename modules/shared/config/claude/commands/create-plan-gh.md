<objective>
  To provide a detailed, step-by-step guide for creating a structured project plan in GitHub Issues, maximizing the use of `gh` CLI for speed and falling back to the UI only when necessary.
</objective>

<workflow>

  <phase name="Decomposition & Strategy Selection" number="1">
    - **Goal**: Break down a large project into a clear, written list of tasks and choose the appropriate GitHub issue management strategy.
    - **Action**: Before touching the CLI, write down a list of all tasks in a text editor.
      - 1.  **Parent/Epic Task**: A high-level task that represents the whole project. (e.g., `Epic: Implement new auth system`)
      - 2.  **Sub-tasks**: The smaller, concrete tasks required to complete the project. (e.g., `Design DB schema`, `Create login API`, `Build UI form`)
    - **Strategy Selection**: Choose one of the following based on project complexity and team preference:
      - **Option 1.1: Simple (Checklist Method)**: For smaller projects or when formal sub-issues are not needed. All tasks are managed within the body of a single GitHub issue using a checklist.
      - **Option 1.2: Advanced (Parent/Child Issues)**: For larger, more complex projects where individual task tracking, assignment, and discussion are required. Uses GitHub's official parent/child issue hierarchy.
  </phase>

  <phase name="Issue Creation (CLI)" number="2">
    - **Goal**: Rapidly create issues in GitHub using the `gh` CLI, based on the chosen strategy.
    - **Action**: Run the following commands in your terminal. We'll add a `new-plan` label to easily find them later and assign them to yourself (`@me`).

    - **Strategy 2.1: Simple (Checklist Method)**
      - **Step 2.1.1: Create a Single Tracking Issue**
        ```bash
        # This command creates the main issue that will contain all tasks as a checklist.
        gh issue create --title "Project: Implement new auth system" --body "This issue tracks all tasks for the new authentication system. Tasks will be managed as a checklist within this issue.\n\n- [ ] Design DB schema\n- [ ] Create login API\n- [ ] Build UI form" --label "project,new-plan" --assignee "@me"
        ```
      - **Note**: For this strategy, you only create one issue. All sub-tasks are listed directly in its body.

    - **Strategy 2.2: Advanced (Parent/Child Issues)**
      - **Step 2.2.1: Create the Parent Issue**
        ```bash
        # This command creates the main tracking issue (the Epic).
        gh issue create --title "Epic: Implement new auth system" --body "This Epic tracks all tasks for the new authentication system." --label "epic,new-plan" --assignee "@me"
        ```
      - **Step 2.2.2: Create the Sub-issues**
        ```bash
        # Run one command for each sub-issue. The CLI will prompt you for the body text.
        gh issue create --title "Design auth DB schema" --label "new-plan" --assignee "@me"
        gh issue create --title "Create login API endpoint" --label "new-plan" --assignee "@me"
        gh issue create --title "Build login UI form" --label "new-plan" --assignee "@me"
        ```
      - **Step 2.2.3: Collect Issue URLs**
        - **Crucial**: After running each `gh issue create` command, the CLI will output the URL of the newly created issue. **Copy these URLs into a temporary text file.** You will need them in the next phase to establish the hierarchy.
  </phase>

  <phase name="Establish Hierarchy (Conditional)" number="3">
    - **Goal**: Establish the parent-child relationship if the Advanced strategy was chosen.
    - **Action**: This phase is only applicable if you chose **Strategy 1.2: Advanced (Parent/Child Issues)** in Phase 1.

    - **Option 3.1: Using GitHub Web UI (Recommended for Simplicity)**
      - **Reason**: This is the simplest and most direct method as `gh` CLI does not yet have a dedicated command for this.
      - **Steps**:
        1.  Open the URL of the **Parent Issue** in your browser.
        2.  In the right-hand sidebar, find the **"Development"** section and click the gear icon.
        3.  Select **"Add issue from URL"**.
        4.  Paste the URLs of the **Sub-issues** you saved earlier.

    - **Option 3.2: Using `gh` CLI with GraphQL API (Advanced)**
      - **Reason**: For advanced users who prefer to stay entirely within the terminal, this method leverages the `gh api graphql` command to directly interact with GitHub's powerful GraphQL API. This allows for more granular control and automation of issue relationships, especially when the standard `gh` CLI commands do not offer direct support for specific features like linking sub-issues.
      - **Steps**:
        1.  **Obtain `node_id`s for Parent and Sub-issues**: GitHub's GraphQL API identifies objects (like issues) using a unique `node_id` rather than their sequential issue number. You *must* retrieve the `node_id` for both your parent issue and each sub-issue you intend to link. The `gh issue view` command is used for this purpose, extracting the `id` field from its JSON output.
          ```bash
          PARENT_ID=$(gh issue view <PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER> --json id --jq '.id')
          SUB_ISSUE_1_ID=$(gh issue view <SUB_ISSUE_1_NUMBER> --json id --jq '.id')
          SUB_ISSUE_2_ID=$(gh issue view <SUB_ISSUE_2_NUMBER> --json id --jq '.id')
          # ... and so on for all sub-issues you created
          ```
          *Replace `<PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER>` and `<SUB_ISSUE_X_NUMBER>` with the actual issue numbers (e.g., 123) that `gh issue create` returned.*

        2.  **Link Sub-issues using a GraphQL Mutation**: Once you have the `node_id`s, you can execute a GraphQL mutation to establish the parent-child relationship. You will run this command *for each sub-issue* you want to link to the parent. The `addSubIssue` mutation is specifically designed for this purpose.
          ```bash
          # Example: Linking SUB_ISSUE_1_ID to PARENT_ID
          gh api graphql -H "GraphQL-Features: issue_subissues" -f query='\
            mutation AddSubIssue($issueId: ID!, $subIssueId: ID!) {\
              addSubIssue(input: {\
                issueId: $issueId,\
                subIssueId: $subIssueId\
              }) {\
                issue {\
                  title\
                }\
                subIssue {\
                  title\
                }\
              }\
            }' -f issueId="$PARENT_ID" -f subIssueId="$SUB_ISSUE_1_ID"
          ```
          *Repeat the `gh api graphql` command for every sub-issue you need to link. This method directly manipulates the issue hierarchy via the API and has been verified to work.*
  </phase>

  <phase name="Verification" number="4">
    - **Goal**: Confirm the plan is structured correctly based on the chosen strategy.

    - **Strategy 4.1: Simple (Checklist Method) Verification**
      - **Action**: Open the single tracking issue in GitHub. Verify that all tasks are listed as checklist items in the issue body.
      - **Report Success**: The plan is now fully structured in GitHub and ready for execution.

    - **Strategy 4.2: Advanced (Parent/Child Issues) Verification**
      - **Action**: In the parent issue on GitHub, you should now see a progress bar (e.g., "3 of 3 tasks complete") and a checklist of all your sub-issues. This confirms the hierarchy is correctly established.
      - **Report Success**: The plan is now fully structured in GitHub and ready for execution.
  </phase>

</workflow>

<constraints>
  - The final output is a structured set of GitHub issues, either as a single issue with a checklist or a parent issue tracking multiple sub-issues.
  - CLI is used for creation; UI or advanced CLI is used for establishing relationships (if applicable).
</constraints>

<validation>
  - All tasks from the initial list exist as GitHub issues or as checklist items within an issue.
  - If the Advanced strategy was chosen, the parent issue correctly tracks the completion status of all sub-issues.
