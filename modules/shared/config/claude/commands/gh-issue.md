# GitHub Issue Workflow

Handle a specific GitHub issue with a systematic approach:

1. **Review the GitHub issue** and understand the requirements
2. **Post a detailed plan** as a comment on the issue explaining your approach
3. **Create a new branch** based on the current working branch to avoid merge conflicts
4. **Implement your solution:**
   - Write robust, well-documented code
   - Include comprehensive tests and debug logging
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
5. **Confirm all tests pass** before proceeding
6. **Commit your changes** and open a pull request referencing the issue
7. **Keep the issue open** until the pull request is merged

The issue number should be provided as: `github issue #[NUMBER]`

Focus on delivering a complete, production-ready solution that fully addresses the issue requirements.
