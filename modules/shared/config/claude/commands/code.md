# Code Implementation Workflow

A systematic approach to implementing code based on approved plans.

## Step 1: Implement Code (Coding)

**Objective:** Write the actual code according to the approved plan.

**Prompt Example:**

> "The plan has been approved. Now, implement the code following the plan exactly. Verify each part against the plan and ensure it's a sound solution."

---

## Step 2: Commit & Document

**Objective:** Commit the completed code and update documentation to finalize the task.

**Prompt Example:**

> "The code is complete. Please:
>
> 1. Commit with message: '\[Feat: Brief description]'.
> 2. Push to the feature branch: 'feat/\[branch-name]'.
> 3. Open a Pull Request targeting 'main'.
> 4. Update README.md and CHANGELOG.md with a summary of the changes."
