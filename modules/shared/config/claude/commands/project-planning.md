2. **Analyze Codebase**: Use glob/search to find relevant files
3. **Formulate Plan**: Create step-by-step implementation plan
4. **Track & Execute**: Update GitHub issues or Jira tickets

**Complex Planning** (enterprise projects):
1. **Requirements & Technology**: Analyze specs, propose 3-5 technology options with trade-offs, STOP for user approval
2. **Project Blueprint**: Draft technical architecture, define system boundaries, identify critical dependencies
3. **Phase Breakdown**: Create 3-5 major phases, detailed work tickets, timeline estimates
4. **Execution Planning**: Risk assessment, resource allocation, testing strategy, deployment considerations
