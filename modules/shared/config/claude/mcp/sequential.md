# Sequential: Complex Analysis & Step-by-Step Thinking

Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential thoughts.

## Use Case
Analysis, planning, strategy development, complex debugging, architecture decisions

## Trigger Keywords
"analyze", "step-by-step", "plan", "strategy", "architecture", "debug", "breakdown", "thinking"

## Practical Usage
- "Analyze this error step by step" → Sequential priority activation
- "Microservice design strategy" → Sequential utilization
- "Complex debugging approach" → Sequential engagement

## Best Practices

### Effective Sequential Usage
- **Complex Problems**: Multi-step analysis requiring deep thinking
- **Architecture Decisions**: Strategic planning and trade-off analysis
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic debugging and problem resolution
- **Planning Tasks**: Breaking down complex implementations

### Common Usage Patterns
```bash
# Complex Problem Solving
"Analyze authentication flow bottleneck" → Sequential consideration
"Debug performance issue systematically" → Sequential activation
"Plan microservice migration strategy" → Sequential utilization

# Multi-Step Analysis
"Breakdown user registration workflow" → Sequential engagement
"Analyze security vulnerabilities step-by-step" → Sequential priority
```

### Integration Points
- **Analysis + Testing**: Sequential + Playwright coordination
- **Research + Analysis**: Context7 + Sequential combination
- **Strategic Planning**: Sequential + expert agent delegation

## Performance Characteristics
- **Token Usage**: Higher due to thinking process, but more accurate results
- **Quality**: Significantly better analysis and problem resolution
- **Use Cases**: Reserve for complex problems requiring deep analysis

## Fallback Strategy
- **Sequential Unavailable**: Basic step-by-step manual analysis
- **Limited Thinking**: Break problem into smaller parts manually
- **Alternative**: Use --think flags for structured reasoning
