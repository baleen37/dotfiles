# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured questioning and alternative exploration.

**Core principle:** Ask questions to understand, explore alternatives, present design incrementally for validation.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design."

## Quick Reference

| Phase                       | Key Activities                   | Tool Usage                             | Output                               |

## The Process

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
Brainstorming Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Understanding (purpose, constraints, criteria gathered)
- [ ] Phase 2: Exploration (2-3 approaches proposed and evaluated)
- [ ] Phase 3: Design Presentation (design validated in sections)
- [ ] Phase 4: Design Documentation (design written to docs/plans/)
- [ ] Phase 5: Worktree Setup (if implementing)
- [ ] Phase 6: Planning Handoff (if implementing)
```

### Phase 1: Understanding

- Check current project state in working directory
- Ask ONE question at a time to refine the idea
- **Use AskUserQuestion tool** when you have multiple choice options
- Gather: Purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Example using AskUserQuestion:**

```
Question: "Where should the authentication data be stored?"
Options:
  - "Session storage" (clears on tab close, more secure)
  - "Local storage" (persists across sessions, more convenient)
  - "Cookies" (works with SSR, compatible with older approach)
```

### Phase 2: Exploration

- Propose 2-3 different approaches
- For each: Core architecture, trade-offs, complexity assessment
- **Use AskUserQuestion tool** to present approaches as structured choices
- Ask your human partner which approach resonates

**Example using AskUserQuestion:**

```
Question: "Which architectural approach should we use?"
Options:
  - "Event-driven with message queue" (scalable, complex setup, eventual consistency)
  - "Direct API calls with retry logic" (simple, synchronous, easier to debug)
  - "Hybrid with background jobs" (balanced, moderate complexity, best of both)
```

### Phase 3: Design Presentation

- Present in 200-300 word sections
- Cover: Architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Ask after each section: "Does this look right so far?" (open-ended)
- Use open-ended questions here to allow freeform feedback

### Phase 4: Design Documentation

After design is validated, write it to a permanent document:

- **File location:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` (use actual date and descriptive topic)
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely (if available) for documentation quality
- **Content:** Capture the design as discussed and validated in Phase 3, organized into the sections that emerged from the conversation
- Commit the design document to git before proceeding

### Phase 5: Worktree Setup (for implementation)

When design is approved and implementation will follow:

- Announce: "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees
- Follow that skill's process for directory selection, safety verification, and setup
- Return here when worktree ready

### Phase 6: Planning Handoff

Ask: "Ready to create the implementation plan?"

When your human partner confirms (any affirmative response):

- Announce: "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:writing-plans
- Create detailed plan in the worktree

## Question Patterns

### When to Use AskUserQuestion Tool

**Use AskUserQuestion for:**

- Phase 1: Clarifying questions with 2-4 clear options
- Phase 2: Architectural approach selection (2-3 alternatives)
- Any decision with distinct, mutually exclusive choices
- When options have clear trade-offs to explain

**Benefits:**

- Structured presentation of options with descriptions
- Clear trade-off visibility for partner
- Forces explicit choice (prevents vague "maybe both" responses)

### When to Use Open-Ended Questions

**Use open-ended questions for:**

- Phase 3: Design validation ("Does this look right so far?")
- When you need detailed feedback or explanation
- When partner should describe their own requirements
- When structured options would limit creative input

**Example decision flow:**

- "What authentication method?" → Use AskUserQuestion (2-4 options)
- "Does this design handle your use case?" → Open-ended (validation)

## When to Revisit Earlier Phases

```dot
digraph revisit_phases {
    rankdir=LR;
    "New constraint revealed?" [shape=diamond];
    "Partner questions approach?" [shape=diamond];
    "Requirements unclear?" [shape=diamond];
    "Return to Phase 1" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    "Return to Phase 2" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffffcc"];
    "Continue forward" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccffcc"];

    "New constraint revealed?" -> "Return to Phase 1" [label="yes"];
    "New constraint revealed?" -> "Partner questions approach?" [label="no"];
    "Partner questions approach?" -> "Return to Phase 2" [label="yes"];
    "Partner questions approach?" -> "Requirements unclear?" [label="no"];
    "Requirements unclear?" -> "Return to Phase 1" [label="yes"];
    "Requirements unclear?" -> "Continue forward" [label="no"];
}
```

**You can and should go backward when:**

- Partner reveals new constraint during Phase 2 or 3 → Return to Phase 1
- Validation shows fundamental gap in requirements → Return to Phase 1
- Partner questions approach during Phase 3 → Return to Phase 2
- Something doesn't make sense → Go back and clarify

**Don't force forward linearly** when going backward would give better results.

## Key Principles

| Principle                  | Application                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One question at a time** | Phase 1: Single question per message, use AskUserQuestion for choices |
| **Structured choices**     | Use AskUserQuestion tool for 2-4 options with trade-offs              |
| **YAGNI ruthlessly**       | Remove unnecessary features from all designs                          |
| **Explore alternatives**   | Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling                         |
| **Incremental validation** | Present design in sections, validate each                             |
| **Flexible progression**   | Go backward when needed - flexibility > rigidity                      |
| **Announce usage**         | State skill usage at start of session                                 |
