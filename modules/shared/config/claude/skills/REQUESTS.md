## Guidelines

- **Be specific** - "Flaky test debugging" not "testing help"
- **Include symptoms** - Error messages, behavior patterns
- **Explain non-obvious** - Why can't you just figure this out?
- **One skill per request** - Keep them focused

your human partner reviews this periodically and we create skills together.
