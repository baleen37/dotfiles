# Localizing Variables

## Overview

The Principle of Proximity: Keep related actions together. Declare variables in the smallest scope possible, initialize them close to where they're first used, and keep all references to a variable close together.

**Core principle:** Minimize the window of vulnerability. The smaller the scope and the closer the references, the less can go wrong and the easier code is to understand.

**Goal:** Reduce what you must keep in mind at any one time.

## When to Use

**Apply to every variable you declare:**

- When declaring variables
- When initializing variables
- When reviewing code with scattered variable usage
- When refactoring to improve clarity

**Warning signs:**

- Variables declared at top of function, used at bottom
- All variables initialized together, far from first use
- Large gap between variable declaration and use
- Must scroll to see variable declaration and usage together
- Variables have function/class scope when could be more local
- Can't see all uses of variable on one screen

## Key Concepts

### Scope

How widely visible a variable is:

- **Block scope** - visible only within `{}` or indented block (smallest)
- **Loop scope** - visible only within loop
- **Function scope** - visible throughout function
- **Class scope** - visible to all methods in class
- **Module scope** - visible throughout file
- **Global scope** - visible everywhere (largest, avoid)

**Rule:** Start with smallest scope. Expand only if necessary.

### Span

Distance between successive references to a variable:

```python
a = 0  # First reference
b = 0  # 1 line between references to a
c = 0  # 2 lines between references to a
a = b + c  # Second reference
# Span of a: 2 lines
```

**Goal:** Minimize span. Keep references close together.

### Live Time

Total statements between first and last reference:

```python
recordIndex = 0  # Line 2 - first reference
# ... 24 lines of other code ...
recordIndex += 1  # Line 28 - last reference
# Live time: 28 - 2 + 1 = 27 statements
```

**Goal:** Minimize live time. Reduce window of vulnerability.

## The Principle of Proximity

**Keep related actions together:**

❌ **Bad (declarations far from use):**

```python
def process_data():
    # All declarations at top
    index = 0
    total = 0
    done = False
    result = []

    # 20 lines later...
    while index < count:
        index += 1

    # 30 lines later...
    while not done:
        if total > threshold:
            done = True

    # 40 lines later...
    result.append(final_value)
    return result
```

**Live times:** index=25, total=35, done=35, result=40. Average: 34 lines.

✅ **Good (declare close to use):**

```python
def process_data():
    # Declare index right before loop that uses it
    index = 0
    while index < count:
        index += 1

    # Declare total and done right before loop that uses them
    total = 0
    done = False
    while not done:
        if total > threshold:
            done = True

    # Declare result right before use
    result = []
    result.append(final_value)
    return result
```

**Live times:** index=3, total=5, done=5, result=2. Average: 4 lines.

**Improvement:** 34 → 4 average live time (8.5x better)

## Aggressive Scope Minimization

### Technique 1: Declare at Point of First Use

Languages like C++, Java, Python, JavaScript allow this:

❌ **Bad:**

```python
def calculate_report():
    total = 0  # Declared at top
    count = 0
    average = 0.0

    # 10 lines later...
    total = sum(values)
    count = len(values)
    average = total / count if count > 0 else 0.0
```

✅ **Good:**

```python
def calculate_report():
    # 10 lines of other work...

    # Declare right before use
    total = sum(values)
    count = len(values)
    average = total / count if count > 0 else 0.0
```

### Technique 2: Use Block Scope

In languages supporting block scope, use it:

```python
# Process old data - variables scoped to this block
{
    old_data = get_old_data()
    old_total = sum(old_data)
    print_summary(old_data, old_total)
}  # old_data, old_total die here

# Process new data - fresh variables, no collision
{
    new_data = get_new_data()
    new_total = sum(new_data)
    print_summary(new_data, new_total)
}  # new_data, new_total die here
```

### Technique 3: Initialize at Declaration

❌ **Bad:**

```python
# Declare and initialize separately
user_count: int
user_count = 0

active_users: list
active_users = []
```

✅ **Good:**

```python
# Initialize when declaring
user_count = 0
active_users = []
```

### Technique 4: Use Loop-Scoped Variables

Many languages support declaring loop variables in the loop:

```python
# Variable i exists ONLY within this loop
for i in range(count):
    process(i)
# i doesn't exist here

# Another loop can use i without conflict
for i in range(other_count):
    process_other(i)
```

### Technique 5: Group Related Statements

Keep statements working with same variables together:

❌ **Bad (scattered):**

```python
old_data = get_old_data()
new_data = get_new_data()
old_total = sum(old_data)
new_total = sum(new_data)
print_old_summary(old_data, old_total)
print_new_summary(new_data, new_total)
```

**Must track 6 variables simultaneously**

✅ **Good (grouped):**

```python
# Group 1: Old data (track 2 variables)
old_data = get_old_data()
old_total = sum(old_data)
print_old_summary(old_data, old_total)

# Group 2: New data (track 2 variables)
new_data = get_new_data()
new_total = sum(new_data)
print_new_summary(new_data, new_total)
```

**Track only 2 variables at a time**

## Minimize Global/Class Variables

**Globals have enormous scope, span, and live time** - avoid them.

❌ **Bad:**

```python
total = 0  # Global

def add_to_total(value):
    global total
    total += value  # Total lives forever, visible everywhere

def get_total():
    global total
    return total
```

✅ **Good:**

```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self._total = 0  # Private, encapsulated

    def add(self, value):
        self._total += value  # Scoped to class

    def get_total(self):
        return self._total
```

**Even better (eliminate state if possible):**

```python
def calculate_total(values):
    return sum(values)  # No state, no scope issues
```

## Measuring Improvement

### Calculate Span

Count lines between successive references:

```python
value = 10  # Reference 1
line_a()    # 1 line between
line_b()    # 2 lines between
result = value * 2  # Reference 2
# Span: 2 lines
```

**Target:** Average span < 5 lines

### Calculate Live Time

Count lines from first to last reference (inclusive):

```python
count = 0      # Line 5 - first reference
# ... code ...
count += 1     # Line 42 - last reference
# Live time: 42 - 5 + 1 = 38 lines
```

**Target:** Average live time < 10 lines

**Global variables:** Infinite live time (another reason to avoid)

## Common Mistakes

**❌ All variables at top (C-style):**

```python
def process():
    # Declare everything at top
    i = 0
    j = 0
    total = 0
    result = []
    temp = None

    # Use i 20 lines later
    for i in range(10):
        ...
```

**✅ Declare where used:**

```python
def process():
    # Use variables close to declaration
    for i in range(10):  # i scoped to loop
        ...

    total = 0  # Declared right before use
    for item in items:
        total += item
```

---

**❌ Wide scope when narrow would work:**

```python
def calculate():
    result = 0  # Function scope

    if condition_a:
        result = calculate_a()  # Could be block-scoped
        print(result)
    # result accessible here but not used

    if condition_b:
        result = calculate_b()  # Reusing same variable
        print(result)
```

✅ **Narrow scope:**

```python
def calculate():
    if condition_a:
        result = calculate_a()  # Block scope
        print(result)
    # result doesn't exist here

    if condition_b:
        result = calculate_b()  # Fresh variable, no collision
        print(result)
```

---

**❌ Long live time:**

```python
index = 0  # Line 2
# ... 50 lines of unrelated code ...
while index < count:  # Line 52 - finally used
    index += 1
# Live time: 51 lines
```

✅ **Short live time:**

```python
# ... 50 lines of other code ...

index = 0  # Line 52 - right before use
while index < count:
    index += 1
# Live time: 2 lines
```

## Practical Guidelines

### 1. Initialize at Declaration

Languages like C++, Java, Python, JavaScript support this:

```python
# ✅ Declare and initialize together
user_count = 0
active_users = get_active_users()
total_revenue = calculate_revenue(orders)
```

### 2. Loop Variables in Loop Declaration

```python
# ✅ Loop variable scoped to loop
for user in users:
    process(user)  # user exists only here

for item in items:
    handle(item)  # item exists only here
```

### 3. Initialize Before Loop, Not at Function Start

❌ **Bad:**

```python
def process_records():
    index = 0  # Line 2

    # 30 lines of other work...

    # Finally use index
    while index < record_count:  # Line 32
        index += 1
```

✅ **Good:**

```python
def process_records():
    # 30 lines of other work...

    # Initialize right before loop
    index = 0
    while index < record_count:
        index += 1
```

**Why:** When you modify code and add outer loop, initialization is correctly placed for re-initialization on each pass.

### 4. Extract Related Statements Into Routines

Long routines create large scope. Break into smaller routines:

```python
# ✅ Each routine has small scope
def process_old_data():
    old_data = get_old_data()  # Scoped to this routine only
    old_total = sum(old_data)
    return old_total

def process_new_data():
    new_data = get_new_data()  # Fresh variable, no collision
    new_total = sum(new_data)
    return new_total
```

Variables automatically die when routine exits.

### 5. Prefer Most Restricted Visibility

**Hierarchy (most restricted to least):**

1. Block/loop local (if language supports)
2. Function local
3. Private instance variable
4. Protected instance variable
5. Public instance variable
6. Module-level
7. Global

**Start at #1, move down only if necessary.**

## Convenience vs Intellectual Manageability

**Two philosophies:**

### Convenience Philosophy

"Make variables global so they're convenient to access anywhere. Don't fool around with parameter lists."

**Problem:** Easy to write, hard to read/maintain. Any routine can modify any variable. Must understand entire program to modify one part.

### Intellectual Manageability Philosophy

"Keep variables as local as possible. Hide information. Minimize what you must think about at once."

**Benefit:** Harder to write (must think about scope), easier to read/maintain. Can understand one routine without knowing all others.

**Code Complete's recommendation:** Favor intellectual manageability. Code is read 10x more than written.

## Example Transformation

**❌ Before (wide scope, long live time):**

```python
def summarize_data():
    # All variables at top with function scope
    old_data = None
    num_old = 0
    total_old = 0
    new_data = None
    num_new = 0
    total_new = 0

    old_data = get_old_data()  # Line 8
    num_old = len(old_data)
    total_old = sum(old_data)
    print_summary(old_data, total_old, num_old)  # Line 11
    save_summary(total_old, num_old)

    new_data = get_new_data()  # Line 14
    num_new = len(new_data)
    total_new = sum(new_data)
    print_summary(new_data, total_new, num_new)  # Line 17
    save_summary(total_new, num_new)
```

**Must track 6 variables throughout entire function. Live times: old_data=4, new_data=4, etc.**

✅ **After (narrow scope, short live time):**

```python
def summarize_data():
    # Group 1: Old data (variables live only 4 lines)
    old_data = get_old_data()
    num_old = len(old_data)
    total_old = sum(old_data)
    print_summary(old_data, total_old, num_old)
    save_summary(total_old, num_old)
    # old_data, num_old, total_old mentally "die" here

    # Group 2: New data (fresh variables, 4 lines)
    new_data = get_new_data()
    num_new = len(new_data)
    total_new = sum(new_data)
    print_summary(new_data, total_new, num_new)
    save_summary(total_new, num_new)
```

**Track 3 variables at a time. Same live times, but mental load reduced.**

✅ **Even better (extract to routines):**

```python
def summarize_data():
    process_old_data()  # Variables scoped inside
    process_new_data()  # Variables scoped inside

def process_old_data():
    # Variables live only in this routine (5 lines)
    old_data = get_old_data()
    num_old = len(old_data)
    total_old = sum(old_data)
    print_summary(old_data, total_old, num_old)
    save_summary(total_old, num_old)
    # Variables die when routine exits
```

**Track 3 variables maximum. Variables automatically cleaned up.**

## Quick Reference

| Situation                 | Technique                        | Example                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loop variable**         | Declare in loop                  | `for i in range(n):`                              |
| **Temporary calculation** | Inline or immediate use          | `total = sum(values)` right before `print(total)` |
| **Used in one block**     | Declare in that block            | if-block variable stays in if-block               |
| **Used across function**  | Function-local only if necessary | Don't make it class/global                        |
| **Shared across methods** | Private instance variable        | Not public unless necessary                       |
| **Truly global**          | Access routine instead           | Wrap in getter/setter                             |

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Loop Counters

```python
# ✅ Counter scoped to loop
for i in range(len(items)):
    process(items[i])
# i doesn't exist here - good

# Can reuse i in another loop without collision
for i in range(len(others)):
    process(others[i])
```

### Pattern 2: Calculation Results

```python
# ✅ Calculate right before use
def generate_report():
    # Other work...

    # Calculate only when needed, use immediately
    total_revenue = sum(order.total for order in orders)
    print(f"Total Revenue: ${total_revenue}")

    # Different calculation later
    active_user_count = len([u for u in users if u.is_active])
    print(f"Active Users: {active_user_count}")
```

### Pattern 3: Temporary Values

```python
# ✅ Temporary lives only 2-3 lines
def swap_values(arr, i, j):
    temp = arr[i]  # Temporary variable
    arr[i] = arr[j]
    arr[j] = temp  # temp used and done (live time: 3 lines)
```

### Pattern 4: Iteration State

```python
# ✅ State variables near the loop they control
def process_until_done():
    # Other work...

    # Declare state right before loop
    done = False
    attempts = 0
    while not done and attempts < max_attempts:
        done = try_process()
        attempts += 1
```

## Measuring Your Code

Calculate average span and live time for a function:

```python
def example():
    a = 0      # Line 2, ref 1
    b = 0      # Line 3
    c = 0      # Line 4
    a = b + c  # Line 5, ref 2 of a
    d = a * 2  # Line 6, ref 3 of a

# Span of a: (5-2=3) + (6-5=1) = 4, average 2
# Live time of a: 6-2+1 = 5 lines
```

**Good metrics:**

- Average span: < 5 lines
- Average live time: < 10 lines

**If higher:** Consider localizing more aggressively.

## Benefits

### 1. Reduces Window of Vulnerability

Shorter live time = fewer lines where variable could be incorrectly modified:

```python
# Live time = 50 lines
value = 0  # Line 1
# ... 48 lines where value could be accidentally changed ...
return value  # Line 50

vs.

# Live time = 2 lines
value = calculate()  # Line 49
return value  # Line 50 - less can go wrong
```

### 2. Easier to Understand

Seeing declaration and usage together aids comprehension:

```python
# ✅ See both on one screen
count = len(items)
print(f"Processing {count} items")

# ❌ Must scroll to see declaration
# ... Line 1: count = 0
# ... 50 lines later...
# ... Line 51: print(f"Processing {count} items")  # What's count?
```

### 3. Reduces Initialization Errors

Variables initialized close to use are less likely to have stale values:

```python
# ✅ Initialized fresh each loop iteration
for batch in batches:
    count = 0  # Reset for each batch
    for item in batch:
        count += 1
```

vs.

```python
# ❌ Might forget to reset
count = 0  # Top of function
for batch in batches:
    # Forgot to reset count - accumulates across batches!
    for item in batch:
        count += 1
```

### 4. Easier Refactoring

Short live time makes extracting to separate routine easier:

```python
# Related statements with short-lived variables
# are easy to extract into their own routine
old_data = get_old_data()  # Lines 10-13
old_total = sum(old_data)
print_summary(old_data, old_total)
# → Extract to process_old_data() routine
```

## Quick Checklist

For each variable, ask:

- [ ] Is this declared in smallest possible scope?
- [ ] Could it be loop-scoped instead of function-scoped?
- [ ] Could it be function-local instead of class-level?
- [ ] Is it initialized close to first use?
- [ ] Are all references to it close together?
- [ ] Could I extract this section into a routine to reduce scope further?
- [ ] If class/global variable: could it be passed as parameter instead?

**If any answer is "yes, could be smaller" → localize it.**

## Real-World Impact

From Code Complete:

- Research shows shorter live times correlate with fewer errors
- Proximity aids comprehension
- Local scope prevents unintended side effects
- Baseline test: agent declared all variables at top (live time ~15-25 lines)
- Better practice: average live time < 10 lines

**Key insight:** The more you can hide, the less you must keep in mind. The less in mind, the fewer errors.

## Integration with Other Skills

**For initialization:** See patterns in skills/designing-before-coding for thinking about data initialization early in design

**For naming:** See skills/naming-variables - short-lived local variables can have shorter names; longer-lived variables need more descriptive names
