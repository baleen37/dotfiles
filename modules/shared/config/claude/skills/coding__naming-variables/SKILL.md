# Naming Variables

## Overview

The most important consideration in naming a variable is that the name fully and accurately describes the entity the variable represents.

**Core principle:** A variable and its name are essentially the same thing. The goodness or badness of a variable is largely determined by its name.

**Name quality = Design quality.** If you struggle to name something well, that's a warning sign about the design.

## When to Use

**Always use when:**

- Naming any variable, function, class, parameter, constant
- Reviewing code with unclear names
- Struggling to understand what a variable does

**Warning signs you need better names:**

- Variables named `x`, `x1`, `x2`, `temp`, `data`, `info`, `val`
- Can't remember what a variable does
- Need to search back to find variable's purpose
- Abbreviations that aren't obvious
- Names that could mean multiple things
- Struggling to name something (indicates design problem)

## Naming Principles

### 1. Describe What, Not How

**Problem-oriented** (what it represents) not **solution-oriented** (how it's implemented):

✅ **Good:** `employeeData`, `printerReady`, `totalRevenue`
❌ **Bad:** `inputRec`, `bitFlag`, `calcVal`

The bad names describe computing concepts (input, record, bit, calculation). Good names describe the problem domain (employee, printer, revenue).

### 2. Use Optimal Name Length

**Optimal: 10-16 characters average**

- Too short: doesn't convey meaning
- Too long: hard to type, obscures structure

| Too Long                                | Too Short          | Just Right                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `numberOfPeopleOnTheUsOlympicTeam`      | `n`, `np`, `ntm`   | `numTeamMembers`, `teamMemberCount` |
| `numberOfSeatsInTheStadium`             | `n`, `ns`, `nsisd` | `numSeatsInStadium`, `seatCount`    |
| `maximumNumberOfPointsInModernOlympics` | `m`, `mp`, `max`   | `teamPointsMax`, `pointsRecord`     |

**Exception:** Short names OK for very limited scope (loop index `i` in 3-line loop)

### 3. Scope Affects Name Length

- **Long scope (class, global):** Longer, more descriptive names
- **Short scope (loop variable, local):** Shorter acceptable
- **Very short scope (5-line loop):** `i`, `j` acceptable

Short name says: "I'm a scratch value with limited scope, don't look for me elsewhere"

### 4. State What Variable Represents

Effective technique: state in words what the variable represents. Often that statement IS the best name.

**Example:**

- "Running total of checks written to date" → `runningTotal` or `checkTotal`
- "Velocity of a bullet train" → `velocity`, `trainVelocity`, `velocityInMph`
- "Current date" → `currentDate`, `todaysDate`

### 5. Computed-Value Qualifiers at End

Put qualifiers like `Total`, `Sum`, `Average`, `Max`, `Min`, `Count` at the END:

✅ **Good:** `revenueTotal`, `expenseAverage`, `pointsMax`, `customerCount`
❌ **Bad:** `totalRevenue` mixed with `revenueTotal` (inconsistent)

**Why:**

- Most significant part (revenue, expense) at front, read first
- Symmetry: `revenueTotal`, `revenueAverage`, `revenueMax`
- Prevents confusion (`totalRevenue` vs `revenueTotal` - pick one convention)

**Exception:** `Num` is ambiguous

- At start = total: `numCustomers` (count of all customers)
- At end = index: `customerNum` (specific customer number)
- **Better:** Use `Count` for total, `Index` for specific: `customerCount`, `customerIndex`

### 6. Use Obvious Words

Don't be clever. Use the ordinary, obvious words:

✅ `currentDate`, `employeeName`, `accountBalance`
❌ `cd`, `empNm`, `acctBal`

Programmers sometimes overlook using ordinary words, which is often the easiest solution.

### 7. Be Specific, Not Generic

Names that are too general can be used for anything = not informative:

❌ **Bad:** `x`, `temp`, `data`, `info`, `value`, `variable`
✅ **Good:** `discriminant`, `oldRoot`, `errorMessage`, `customerInfo`, `totalRevenue`

Generic names acceptable ONLY for very limited scope.

## Naming Conventions

Standard patterns for consistency and clarity:

### Computed-Value Qualifiers

Place qualifiers at the **end** of the name:

✅ **Good:** `userCount`, `revenueTotal`, `temperatureMax`, `priceAverage`, `itemsMin`
❌ **Bad:** `totalRevenue` mixed with `revenueTotal` (inconsistent)

**Why at end:**

- Most significant part (user, revenue, temperature) read first
- Symmetry: `revenueTotal`, `revenueAverage`, `revenueMax`
- Prevents confusion between `totalRevenue` and `revenueTotal`

**Common qualifiers:** `Total`, `Sum`, `Average`, `Max`, `Min`, `Count`, `Index`

### Collections (Arrays, Lists, Sets)

Use **plural** names:

✅ **Good:** `users`, `activeCustomers`, `recentOrders`, `errorMessages`
❌ **Bad:** `userList`, `customerArray`, `orderSet` (exposes implementation)

**Exception:** When type disambiguation helps: `userMap`, `userSet` (if you have both in same scope)

### Booleans

Use question form (prefix with `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`):

✅ **Good:** `isValid`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit`, `shouldRetry`, `wasProcessed`
❌ **Bad:** `valid`, `permission`, `edit`, `retry` (not obviously boolean)

**Avoid negative booleans:** `isNotValid` is confusing. Use `isValid` and check `!isValid`.

### Constants

Use **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** for truly constant values:

✅ **Good:** `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `API_BASE_URL`

**Modern alternative:** `const` with regular camelCase (TypeScript, modern JavaScript):

✅ **Also good:** `const maxRetryCount = 3`

Pick one convention per project, stay consistent.

### Index vs Count

**Distinguish clearly:**

- **Count/Total** = how many total: `userCount`, `itemTotal`
- **Index** = which specific one: `userIndex`, `currentItem`

❌ **Confusing:** `userNum` (is it count or index?)
✅ **Clear:** `userCount` (total), `userIndex` (specific)

### Temporary Variables

**Minimize or make semantic:**

❌ **Bad:** `temp`, `tmp`, `t`
✅ **Good:** `oldValue`, `swapBuffer`, `previousState`

If truly temporary and tiny scope (2-3 lines), short is OK. Otherwise, give it semantic meaning.

## Language-Specific Adaptations

### Python (snake_case)

```python
user_count = 0          # count
current_user_index = 0  # index
is_valid = True         # boolean
active_users = []       # collection
MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3     # constant
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript (camelCase)

```typescript
const userCount = 0;          // count
let currentUserIndex = 0;     // index
const isValid = true;         // boolean
const activeUsers = [];       // collection
const MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3;    // constant
```

### Go (mixedCase/camelCase)

```go
userCount := 0           // count
currentUserIndex := 0    // index
isValid := true         // boolean
activeUsers := []User{}  // collection
const MaxRetryCount = 3  // exported constant
```

**Principle applies across languages:** Name describes what it represents, adapt casing to language conventions.

## Common Opposites

Use opposites precisely for consistency:

| Opposite Pairs            |
| ------------------------- |
| `begin` / `end`           |
| `first` / `last`          |
| `locked` / `unlocked`     |
| `min` / `max`             |
| `next` / `previous`       |
| `old` / `new`             |
| `opened` / `closed`       |
| `source` / `target`       |
| `source` / `destination`  |
| `start` / `stop`          |
| `up` / `down`             |
| `get` / `set`             |
| `add` / `remove`          |
| `insert` / `delete`       |
| `show` / `hide`           |
| `create` / `destroy`      |
| `increment` / `decrement` |

Departing from common opposites (like `begin`/`finish` instead of `begin`/`end`) is confusing.

## Variables to Avoid

**Never use unless you have explicit, documented reason:**

❌ `x`, `x1`, `x2` - Always bad (represents unknown quantity)
❌ `temp` - What kind of temporary value?
❌ `data` - What data?
❌ `val`, `value` - What value?
❌ `foo`, `bar`, `baz` - Placeholder nonsense
❌ Single letters except `i`, `j`, `k` for very short loops
❌ Misspellings or weird abbreviations
❌ Names with numbers: `file1`, `file2` (use array instead)
❌ Names differing by only one character: `acctNum` vs `acctNo`

## One Purpose Per Variable

**Never reuse a variable for multiple purposes:**

❌ **Bad:**

```python
# temp used for two unrelated purposes
temp = sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c)
root[0] = (-b + temp) / (2 * a)
...
temp = root[0]  # Now reused for swapping
root[0] = root[1]
root[1] = temp
```

✅ **Good:**

```python
discriminant = sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c)
root[0] = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)
...
old_root = root[0]
root[0] = root[1]
root[1] = old_root
```

**Avoid hidden meanings:**

- `pageCount` = number of pages, UNLESS it equals -1, then it means error occurred ❌
- `customerId` = customer number, UNLESS > 500000, then subtract 500000 for delinquent account ❌

Use separate variables. Don't overload meaning.

## Naming as a Diagnostic Tool

**If naming is hard = design is unclear:**

| Symptom                      | Diagnosis                    | Fix                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Vague name seems OK          | Routine does too many things | Break into smaller routines |
| Multiple equally-vague names | Unclear purpose              | Clarify requirements        |
| Name is long and complicated | Routine is too complex       | Simplify design             |
| Can't decide between 2 names | Routine has dual purpose     | Split into two routines     |
| Name keeps changing          | Design keeps changing        | Stabilize design first      |

**Don't just accept a bad name. Treat it as a red flag about code quality.**

## Quick Naming Checklist

Before accepting a name:

- [ ] Describes WHAT variable represents fully and accurately?
- [ ] Uses problem domain language (not computer terms)?
- [ ] 10-16 characters for anything beyond local scope?
- [ ] Obvious words used (not clever or abbreviated)?
- [ ] Specific enough (not generic like `temp`, `data`)?
- [ ] One purpose only (no hybrid meanings)?
- [ ] Computed qualifiers at end (`Total`, `Max`, `Count`)?
- [ ] If short name, is scope truly tiny (< 10 lines)?

**If any answer is no: improve the name.**

## Real-World Impact

From Code Complete research:

- Programs with names averaging 10-16 characters had minimized debugging effort
- Study found 30%+ improvement in comprehension with well-named abstractions
- Names like `x1`, `x2` prevent understanding relationships between variables
- Vague names correlate with design problems

**Key insight:** "You can't give a variable a name the way you give a dog a name—because it's cute or it has a good sound. A variable and a variable's name are essentially the same thing."

## Example Transformation

❌ **Before (Bad Names):**

```python
x = x - xx
xxx = fido + sales_tax(fido)
x = x + late_fee(x1, x) + xxx
x = x + interest(x1, x)
```

What does this do? What is `x`, `xx`, `xxx`, `fido`, `x1`?

✅ **After (Good Names):**

```python
balance = balance - last_payment
monthly_total = new_purchases + sales_tax(new_purchases)
balance = balance + late_fee(customer_id, balance) + monthly_total
balance = balance + interest(customer_id, balance)
```

Now it's obvious: computing customer bill from balance and new purchases.

**Same code, different names, completely different understandability.**
