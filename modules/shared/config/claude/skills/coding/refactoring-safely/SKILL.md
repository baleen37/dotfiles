# Refactoring Safely

## Overview

Refactoring means changing code structure without changing behavior. Safe refactoring requires tests first, one change at a time, and NEVER mixing refactoring with bug fixes or features.

**Core principle:** Refactoring changes HOW code works internally. Bug fixes change WHAT code does. Never mix HOW and WHAT changes.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of safe refactoring.**

## When to Use

**Use before any refactoring:**

- Improving names
- Extracting methods/classes
- Reducing complexity
- Improving structure
- Code review feedback

**Critical moments:**

- When you discover a bug during refactoring
- When tempted to "add this feature while I'm here"
- When making multiple structural changes
- When refactoring without tests

## The Iron Laws of Safe Refactoring

```
LAW 1: TESTS BEFORE REFACTORING (NO EXCEPTIONS)
LAW 2: ONE CHANGE AT A TIME
LAW 3: NEVER MIX REFACTORING WITH BUG FIXES OR FEATURES
```

Violating any law makes refactoring unsafe.

## Law 1: Tests Before Refactoring

**Before refactoring ANY code, you MUST have passing tests.**

**No exceptions:**

- Don't refactor "and add tests after"
- Don't "manually verify" instead of automated tests
- Don't "trust that it works"
- Don't refactor untested code without adding tests first

**Process:**

1. **If tests exist and pass:** Proceed with refactoring
2. **If tests exist but fail:** Fix tests first, THEN refactor
3. **If no tests exist:** STOP. Add tests. Watch them pass. THEN refactor.

❌ **Without tests (from baseline):**

```python
# Refactor immediately
def calc(x, y, z):  # Bad names
    ...

# Refactor to:
def calculate_capped_product(first, second, multiplier):
    ...
# Hope it still works!
```

✅ **With tests first:**

```python
# Step 1: Add tests
def test_calc():
    assert calc(2, 3, 4) == 20
    assert calc(10, 20, 5) == 100  # Capped
    # Run - ALL PASS

# Step 2: Refactor
def calculate_capped_product(first, second, multiplier):
    sum_of_addends = first + second
    uncapped = sum_of_addends * multiplier
    return min(uncapped, 100)

# Step 3: Run tests again - VERIFY STILL PASS
```

**Tests prove refactoring didn't break behavior.**

## Law 2: One Change at a Time

**Make ONE structural change. Test. Commit. Repeat.**

**Don't:**

- Extract 6 methods simultaneously
- Rename variables AND extract methods together
- Change structure AND algorithms together

**Do:**

- Extract method A. Test. Commit.
- Extract method B. Test. Commit.
- Rename variable X. Test. Commit.

❌ **Multiple changes (risky):**

```python
# Change 1: Extract validation
# Change 2: Extract calculation
# Change 3: Extract persistence
# Change 4: Rename variables
# Change 5: Reorder statements
# Change 6: Add error handling

# If tests fail: which change broke it?
```

✅ **Incremental (safe):**

```python
# Change 1: Extract validation
def validate_order(data):
    ...
# Run tests → PASS → Commit

# Change 2: Extract calculation
def calculate_total(items):
    ...
# Run tests → PASS → Commit

# If any test fails: know exactly which change broke it
```

**From baseline:** Agent chose incremental approach correctly. Skill reinforces this.

## Law 3: Never Mix Refactoring with Bug Fixes

**This is the critical discipline most developers violate.**

**Refactoring = change structure, preserve behavior**
**Bug fix = change behavior to correct it**

**Never do both in the same commit.**

### The Temptation (From Baseline Test 3)

You're refactoring and discover a bug:

```python
# Extracting validation from larger function
def validate_order_items(order_data):
    if not order_data.get('items'):
        return None  # ← BUG: should raise error
```

**Tempting reasoning:**

- "I'm touching this code anyway"
- "It's a trivial fix"
- "Efficient to fix while I'm here"
- "One coherent change"

**Why this is WRONG:**

1. **Diagnosis confusion:** If tests fail after your commit, is it because:
   - Refactoring broke something?
   - Bug fix was wrong?
   - Impossible to tell when mixed

2. **Review confusion:** Reviewer must evaluate:
   - Is the refactoring good?
   - Is the bug fix correct?
   - Mixed changes are harder to review

3. **Revert problems:** If bug fix is wrong, reverting loses good refactoring

4. **Violates single-change principle:** One commit = one purpose

### The Correct Approach

**When you discover a bug during refactoring:**

```
STOP refactoring immediately
STASH or commit refactoring work-in-progress
FIX the bug:
  - Write failing test for bug
  - Fix bug
  - Verify test passes
  - Commit bug fix separately
UNSTASH and continue refactoring
```

**Concrete example:**

```bash
# You're refactoring, discover bug
git stash  # Save refactoring work

# Fix bug in separate commit
# 1. Write test
def test_empty_items_raises_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        validate_order_items({'items': []})
# Run - FAILS (bug exposed)

# 2. Fix bug
def validate_order_items(order_data):
    if not order_data.get('items'):
        raise ValueError("Order must have items")  # Fixed
# Run - PASSES

# 3. Commit bug fix separately
git add test_orders.py orders.py
git commit -m "fix: validate_order_items raises error for empty items"

# Now continue refactoring
git stash pop
# Continue extraction work
```

**Result:** Two clean commits:

1. Bug fix (behavior change)
2. Refactoring (structure change)

**Each can be reviewed, tested, reverted independently.**

## The Refactoring Process

### Step 1: Ensure Tests Exist and Pass

**Before touching any code:**

- [ ] Tests exist for code being refactored?
- [ ] All tests pass?
- [ ] Test coverage is adequate?

**If any "no" → add tests first, watch them pass, THEN refactor.**

### Step 2: Make ONE Structural Change

**Pick smallest possible refactoring:**

- Extract one method
- Rename one variable
- Move one piece of code
- Simplify one conditional

**Not:**

- Extract all methods
- Rename all variables
- Reorganize entire file

### Step 3: Run Tests

**After the change:**

- Run full test suite
- Verify all tests still pass
- If fail: undo change, understand why, try again

### Step 4: Commit

**If tests pass:**

- Commit the single refactoring change
- Clear commit message: "refactor: extract validation method"

### Step 5: Repeat

**For next refactoring:**

- Make next single change
- Test
- Commit
- Repeat until refactoring complete

## Discovered Bug During Refactoring

**From baseline test 3: Agents want to fix bugs while refactoring.**

**NO EXCEPTIONS - Separate the bug fix:**

```markdown
1. STOP refactoring
2. Stash or commit current refactoring work-in-progress
3. Fix bug:
   - Write failing test
   - Fix bug
   - Verify test passes
   - Commit bug fix separately ("fix: ...")
4. Return to refactoring:
   - Unstash work
   - Continue with structural changes
   - Commit refactoring separately ("refactor: ...")
```

**Even if:**

- Bug is trivial (one line)
- You're touching that exact code
- Seems "efficient" to combine
- "Just while I'm here"

**DON'T MIX THEM.**

**Baseline rationalization:** "The bug is right there, trivial fix, same code I'm touching"

**Reality:** Trivial bugs still change behavior. Behavior changes ≠ structural changes. Separate them.

## Discovered Feature Opportunity During Refactoring

**Same principle applies:**

While refactoring, you think "we should add error logging here."

**NO. Don't add features during refactoring.**

1. Note the idea
2. Finish refactoring
3. Commit refactoring
4. THEN add feature in separate commit

**Why:** Same diagnosis/review/revert problems as mixing bug fixes.

## Incremental Refactoring Pattern

**For large refactorings (300-line function → multiple smaller ones):**

**From baseline:** Agent correctly chose incremental approach.

✅ **Incremental (correct):**

```
Extract section 1 → test → commit
Extract section 2 → test → commit
Extract section 3 → test → commit
...
```

**Benefits:**

- Each commit is deployable
- Tests identify which extraction broke something
- Can stop midway if needed
- Progress is visible and safe

❌ **All-at-once (risky):**

```
Extract all 6 sections → test → commit
```

**Problems:**

- If tests fail, which extraction broke it?
- Can't deploy until all done
- All-or-nothing approach

**Always choose incremental.**

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Refactoring without tests:**

```
"It's simple, I can verify manually"
```

**✅ Tests first, always:**

```
Add tests → watch pass → refactor → verify still pass
```

---

**❌ Mixing refactoring + bug fix:**

```
# One commit with both structure change AND behavior change
"refactor: extract validation and fix null handling"
```

**✅ Separate commits:**

```
Commit 1: "fix: validate_order_items raises error for empty items"
Commit 2: "refactor: extract validate_order_items method"
```

---

**❌ Multiple changes in one commit:**

```
Extract 6 methods, rename 5 variables, reorder statements
```

**✅ One change per commit:**

```
Commit 1: Extract method A
Commit 2: Extract method B
...
```

## Red Flags - STOP Refactoring

**Before starting:**

- No tests exist
- Tests fail
- Coverage is inadequate
- Not sure how code behaves

**During refactoring:**

- Discovered a bug
- Found a feature opportunity
- Making multiple changes simultaneously
- Tests failing and not sure why
- Tempted to "fix while I'm here"

**All of these mean: STOP current refactoring, address the issue separately.**

## Common Rationalizations

From baseline testing:

| Excuse                                  | Reality                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Bug is trivial, fix while refactoring" | Trivial bugs still change behavior. Separate commits.            |
| "I'm touching this code anyway"         | Touching ≠ should mix. Separate behavior from structure changes. |
| "Efficient to combine"                  | Efficient to write ≠ efficient to debug/review/revert.           |
| "One coherent change"                   | No - one is behavior, one is structure. Different concerns.      |
| "Tests will catch any issues"           | Tests catch breaks, but can't tell which change broke it.        |
| "Just while I'm here"                   | "While I'm here" scope creep ruins clean refactoring.            |

## Verification Checklist

Before starting refactoring:

- [ ] Tests exist and pass
- [ ] Tests cover code being refactored
- [ ] One refactoring change identified (not multiple)
- [ ] No bug fixes or features mixed in

After each refactoring change:

- [ ] Ran full test suite
- [ ] All tests still pass
- [ ] Committed single change
- [ ] Commit message clear: "refactor: ..."

If discovered bug/feature:

- [ ] Stopped refactoring
- [ ] Stashed or committed WIP
- [ ] Handled bug/feature separately
- [ ] Returned to refactoring after

## Quick Reference

| Situation                    | Action                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **No tests**                 | Add tests first, watch pass, then refactor     |
| **Tests fail**               | Fix tests first, then refactor                 |
| **Large refactoring**        | Break into small steps, test after each        |
| **Bug discovered**           | Stop, stash, fix bug separately, resume        |
| **Feature idea**             | Note it, finish refactoring, add feature after |
| **Multiple changes planned** | Do one, test, commit, repeat                   |

## Real-World Impact

From Code Complete:

- Refactoring is part of construction, not separate phase
- Make small changes, verify each step
- Tested refactoring is safe refactoring

From baseline testing:

- Agents correctly wrote tests first (good baseline)
- Agents correctly chose incremental for large refactorings (good baseline)
- Agents mixed bug fixes with refactoring (VIOLATION - the gap)

**With this skill:** Reinforce good practices, prevent mixing concerns.

## Integration with Other Skills

**For test discipline:** See skills/testing/test-driven-development - tests before ANY code change, including refactoring

**For bug fixes:** See skills/debugging/systematic-debugging - bug fixes require root cause investigation, separate from refactoring

**For focused routines:** See skills/keeping-routines-focused - extraction is a common refactoring, do it incrementally
