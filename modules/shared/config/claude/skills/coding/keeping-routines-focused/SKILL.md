# Keeping Routines Focused

## Overview

A routine should do ONE thing and do it well. This is called functional cohesion - the strongest, best kind of cohesion.

**Core principle:** If a routine's description contains "and", it's doing too many things. Extract into focused routines.

**Goal:** Improve intellectual manageability. The more focused a routine, the easier to understand, test, modify, and reuse.

## When to Use

**Proactively (writing new code):**

- Designing new functions/methods
- Writing routine specifications
- Naming routines (if name is vague or has "and", too many responsibilities)

**Reactively (improving existing code):**

- Reviewing code with long routines
- Refactoring when routine does multiple things
- When routine is hard to understand or test
- When routine keeps growing with each modification

**Warning signs routine needs focus:**

- Description has "and" in it
- Routine name is vague or long
- Routine is hard to name clearly
- Routine is > 200 lines (strong signal)
- Parameter list > 7 parameters
- Many local variables (> 10)
- Multiple levels of abstraction mixed
- Does validation AND calculation AND side-effects
- Hard to write test (does too much to test atomically)

## What is "One Thing"?

**One thing means one level of abstraction:**

✅ **Does one thing:**

```python
def calculate_total_price(items, tax_rate):
    """Calculate total price of items including tax."""
    subtotal = sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items)
    tax = subtotal * tax_rate
    return subtotal + tax
```

Single purpose: price calculation. All statements at same abstraction level (arithmetic).

---

❌ **Does multiple things:**

```python
def handle_order(order_data, user_id):
    """
    Process order:
    - Validate order data
    - Calculate total with tax
    - Apply discount codes
    - Check inventory
    - Create order record
    - Send confirmation email
    - Update user history
    - Return confirmation
    """
    validated = validate_order_data(order_data, user_id)  # Thing 1
    subtotal = calculate_subtotal(validated["items"])     # Thing 2
    discount = apply_discount(subtotal, validated.get("discount_code"))  # Thing 3
    tax = calculate_tax(subtotal - discount, validated["tax_rate"])      # Thing 4
    total = subtotal - discount + tax                      # Thing 5
    check_inventory(validated["items"])                    # Thing 6
    order_record = create_order_record(...)                # Thing 7
    send_confirmation_email(...)                           # Thing 8
    update_user_history(user_id, order_record["order_id"]) # Thing 9
    return {...}  # Thing 10
```

Description has 8 "and"s. Does 10 different things. Violates single responsibility.

## How to Extract Routines

### Technique 1: Extract by Responsibility

Group related statements, extract into focused routine:

**Before (orchestrator does everything):**

```python
def handle_order(order_data, user_id):
    # Validation (lines 1-10)
    validated = validate_order_data(order_data, user_id)

    # Pricing (lines 11-15)
    subtotal = calculate_subtotal(validated["items"])
    discount = apply_discount(subtotal, validated.get("discount_code"))
    tax = calculate_tax(subtotal - discount, validated["tax_rate"])
    total = subtotal - discount + tax

    # Inventory (lines 16-20)
    check_inventory(validated["items"])

    # Persistence (lines 21-30)
    order_record = create_order_record(...)

    # Notifications (lines 31-35)
    send_confirmation_email(...)
    update_user_history(user_id, order_record["order_id"])

    return {...}
```

**After (each phase is focused routine):**

```python
def handle_order(order_data, user_id):
    """Single responsibility: Orchestrate order processing."""
    validated_order = validate_order_request(order_data, user_id)
    pricing = calculate_order_pricing(validated_order)
    verify_inventory_available(validated_order)
    order = create_and_save_order(validated_order, pricing, user_id)
    send_order_notifications(order)
    return create_confirmation_response(order, pricing)

def validate_order_request(order_data, user_id):
    """Single responsibility: Validate order data."""
    # Just validation

def calculate_order_pricing(validated_order):
    """Single responsibility: Calculate prices."""
    # Just pricing math

def verify_inventory_available(validated_order):
    """Single responsibility: Check inventory."""
    # Just inventory check

def create_and_save_order(validated_order, pricing, user_id):
    """Single responsibility: Persist order."""
    # Just database operations

def send_order_notifications(order):
    """Single responsibility: Send notifications."""
    # Just email/notifications
```

**Each routine now has single, clear purpose.**

### Technique 2: Extract Levels of Abstraction

If routine mixes high and low-level operations, extract low-level:

❌ **Mixed abstraction levels:**

```python
def process_report():
    # High level
    data = fetch_data()

    # LOW level detail
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i] is not None and data[i] > 0:
            normalized = (data[i] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
            data[i] = normalized

    # High level
    generate_output(data)
```

✅ **Consistent abstraction:**

```python
def process_report():
    # All high level
    data = fetch_data()
    normalized_data = normalize_values(data)  # Low-level extracted
    generate_output(normalized_data)

def normalize_values(data):
    # Low-level details isolated here
    result = []
    for value in data:
        if value is not None and value > 0:
            normalized = (value - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
            result.append(normalized)
    return result
```

### Technique 3: Extract Complex Conditions

If conditional logic is complex, extract to well-named boolean function:

❌ **Complex inline condition:**

```python
if (user.age >= 18 and user.has_account and
    user.account_balance > minimum and not user.is_suspended and
    user.verified_email):
    allow_purchase()
```

✅ **Extracted condition:**

```python
if is_eligible_for_purchase(user):
    allow_purchase()

def is_eligible_for_purchase(user):
    """Single responsibility: Determine purchase eligibility."""
    return (user.age >= 18 and
            user.has_account and
            user.account_balance > minimum and
            not user.is_suspended and
            user.verified_email)
```

**Benefits:** Name explains WHAT checking, function explains HOW.

## Quick Reference

| Sign Routine Needs Focus | Extraction Technique                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Description has "and"    | Extract each responsibility           |
| Routine > 200 lines      | Extract logical sections              |
| Parameters > 7           | Group related params, extract         |
| Hard to name             | Clarify purpose, split if multiple    |
| Hard to test             | Extract testable pieces               |
| Mixed abstraction levels | Extract low-level details             |

| Long parameter list      | Extract to class or group params      |
| Does A, B, C, D          | Extract B, C, D into focused routines |

## Functional Cohesion

**The gold standard:** Routine does one thing and only that thing.

### Levels of Cohesion (Worst to Best)

1. **Coincidental** - Unrelated things grouped together (avoid)
2. **Logical** - Related things but different operations (weak)
3. **Temporal** - Things done at same time (weak)
4. **Procedural** - Things done in sequence (medium)
5. **Communicational** - Work on same data (medium)
6. **Sequential** - Output of one is input to next (good)
7. **Functional** - Do ONE thing completely (best)

**Always aim for functional cohesion.**

### Examples of Cohesion Types

**❌ Coincidental (worst):**

```python
def miscellaneous_functions():
    initialize_printer()
    calculate_payroll()
    sort_personnel_records()
    # Unrelated things in one routine - terrible
```

**⚠️ Temporal (weak):**

```python
def startup():
    initialize_database()
    initialize_ui()
    initialize_logging()
    # Related by WHEN (startup), not by WHAT
```

**✅ Functional (best):**

```python
def calculate_employee_pay(employee, hours_worked):
    # Does ONE thing: calculate pay
    hourly_rate = employee.rate
    gross_pay = hourly_rate * hours_worked
    deductions = calculate_deductions(gross_pay)
    return gross_pay - deductions
```

## Naming as a Diagnostic

**Routine name reveals focus:**

| Name                                      | Focus Assessment               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `calculateTotal()`                        | ✅ Focused - one clear purpose |
| `processData()`                           | ❌ Vague - what processing?    |
| `getUserAndValidate()`                    | ❌ Two things ("and" in name)  |
| `initializeSystemData()`                  | ⚠️ Might be multiple things    |
| `handleUserRegistrationAndWelcomeEmail()` | ❌ Obviously two things        |

**If you struggle to name a routine clearly, it probably does too many things.**

Extract until naming is easy.

## Parameter Count Guideline

**Research shows:** Routines with > 7 parameters correlate with higher error rates.

**Why?** Many parameters suggest routine is doing too much.

❌ **Too many parameters:**

```python
def create_order(user_id, items, shipping_addr, billing_addr,
                 discount_code, tax_rate, payment_method, notes):
    # 8 parameters - probably doing too much
```

✅ **Group related parameters:**

```python
def create_order(user_id, order_details):
    # 2 parameters - order_details is an object containing the data
```

✅ **Or extract responsibilities:**

```python
def create_order(validated_order, calculated_pricing):
    # Validation and pricing are separate responsibilities
    # This routine just creates the order record
```

## Length Guidelines

**No hard limit, but:**

- Most routines: < 50 lines
- Review if > 100 lines
- Strong signal to extract if > 200 lines

**Exception:** Generated code, complex state machines, extensive error handling

**Question to ask:** Can I extract logical sections without making code worse?

## When to Extract

### Extract When:

1. **Multiple responsibilities** - Routine does A and B and C
2. **Mixed abstraction levels** - High-level calls mixed with low-level details
3. **Complex section** - One part is complex, rest is simple (extract complex part)
4. **Duplicate logic** - Same code appears in multiple places
5. **Hard to test** - Doing too much to test atomically
6. **Poor naming** - Can't name it clearly (probably unfocused)
7. **Long routine** - Natural extraction points exist

### Don't Extract When:

1. **Simpler inline** - Extraction adds more complexity than it removes
2. **Used once** - No duplication, no complexity reduction
3. **No natural boundary** - Arbitrary split would make code harder to understand

**Default:** When in doubt, extract. Extraction rarely makes code worse.

## Extraction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Extract Complex Calculation

```python
# ✅ Extract complex logic
def calculate_mortgage_payment(principal, annual_rate, years):
    monthly_rate = convert_to_monthly_rate(annual_rate)
    num_payments = years * 12
    return calculate_monthly_payment(principal, monthly_rate, num_payments)

def convert_to_monthly_rate(annual_rate):
    return annual_rate / 12 / 100

def calculate_monthly_payment(principal, monthly_rate, num_payments):
    return principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**num_payments) / \
           ((1 + monthly_rate)**num_payments - 1)
```

### Pattern 2: Extract Validation

```python
# ✅ Extract validation to focused routine
def process_payment(payment_data):
    validate_payment_data(payment_data)  # Extracted
    return execute_payment_transaction(payment_data)

def validate_payment_data(data):
    """Single responsibility: validation."""
    # All validation logic here
```

### Pattern 3: Extract by Abstraction Level

```python
# ✅ High-level routine calls lower-level focused routines
def generate_report():
    # High-level orchestration
    data = collect_report_data()
    analysis = analyze_data(data)
    formatted_report = format_report_output(analysis)
    save_report(formatted_report)
    return formatted_report
```

## Common Mistakes

**❌ God function (does everything):**

```python
def handle_user_request():
    # Validation
    # Authentication
    # Authorization
    # Business logic
    # Database operations
    # Logging
    # Email sending
    # Response formatting
    # 300 lines doing 8 different things
```

**✅ Focused orchestrator:**

```python
def handle_user_request(request):
    """Single responsibility: Orchestrate request handling."""
    user = authenticate_user(request)
    authorize_action(user, request.action)
    result = execute_business_logic(request, user)
    save_to_database(result)
    send_notifications(user, result)
    return format_response(result)
```

---

**❌ Mixed abstraction levels:**

```python
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)  # High level

    # Low level details mixed in
    for item in order.items:
        db.execute("UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - ? WHERE id = ?",
                   (item.quantity, item.product_id))

    send_confirmation(order)  # High level
```

✅ **Consistent abstraction:**

```python
def process_order(order):
    """High-level orchestration."""
    validate_order(order)
    update_inventory(order.items)  # Low-level extracted
    send_confirmation(order)

def update_inventory(items):
    """Low-level: Update database."""
    for item in items:
        db.execute("UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - ? WHERE id = ?",
                   (item.quantity, item.product_id))
```

---

**❌ "Utility" routine (does miscellaneous things):**

```python
def utils():
    # Initializes printer
    # Calculates payroll
    # Sorts records
    # Unrelated things - coincidental cohesion (worst)
```

✅ **Focused routines:**

```python
def initialize_printer(): ...
def calculate_payroll(): ...
def sort_personnel_records(): ...
```

## The "And" Test

**Listen to your description of the routine:**

❌ "This routine validates the input AND calculates the result AND sends email"
→ Three responsibilities. Extract 2 of them.

❌ "This gets user data AND formats it for display"
→ Two responsibilities (retrieval and formatting). Extract formatting.

✅ "This calculates the shipping cost based on weight and destination"
→ One responsibility (calculation). The "and" lists parameters, not responsibilities.

**If description has "and" connecting actions → routine does too many things.**

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Need to write/review a routine
  ↓
Does it do ONE thing?
  ├─ YES → Good, keep it focused
  └─ NO → Does description have "and"?
      ├─ YES → Extract responsibilities
      └─ Mixed abstraction levels?
          ├─ YES → Extract low-level details
          └─ > 200 lines?
              ├─ YES → Find natural boundaries, extract
              └─ > 7 parameters?
                  ├─ YES → Group params or extract
                  └─ Hard to name?
                      ├─ YES → Clarify purpose, maybe split
                      └─ Keep as-is, it's focused
```

## Extraction Example

**Original (unfocused):**

```python
def handle_order(order_data, user_id):
    # Validate (responsibility 1)
    if not order_data.get("items"):
        raise ValueError("No items")
    if not user_id:
        raise ValueError("No user")

    # Calculate pricing (responsibility 2)
    subtotal = sum(item["price"] * item["qty"] for item in order_data["items"])
    tax = subtotal * 0.08
    total = subtotal + tax

    # Check inventory (responsibility 3)
    for item in order_data["items"]:
        if inventory[item["id"]] < item["qty"]:
            raise InventoryError()

    # Create record (responsibility 4)
    order_id = f"ORD-{datetime.now().isoformat()}"
    order = {"id": order_id, "user_id": user_id, "total": total}
    save_order(order)

    # Send email (responsibility 5)
    send_email(user_id, f"Order {order_id} confirmed")

    return order
```

**Extracted (focused routines):**

```python
def handle_order(order_data, user_id):
    """Single responsibility: Orchestrate order flow."""
    validate_order_request(order_data, user_id)
    pricing = calculate_pricing(order_data)
    verify_inventory(order_data)
    order = create_order(order_data, pricing, user_id)
    notify_user(order, user_id)
    return order

def validate_order_request(order_data, user_id):
    """Single responsibility: Validation."""
    if not order_data.get("items"):
        raise ValueError("No items")
    if not user_id:
        raise ValueError("No user")

def calculate_pricing(order_data):
    """Single responsibility: Pricing."""
    subtotal = sum(item["price"] * item["qty"] for item in order_data["items"])
    tax = subtotal * 0.08
    return {"subtotal": subtotal, "tax": tax, "total": subtotal + tax}

def verify_inventory(order_data):
    """Single responsibility: Inventory check."""
    for item in order_data["items"]:
        if inventory[item["id"]] < item["qty"]:
            raise InventoryError(f"Insufficient inventory for {item['id']}")

def create_order(order_data, pricing, user_id):
    """Single responsibility: Order creation."""
    order_id = f"ORD-{datetime.now().isoformat()}"
    order = {"id": order_id, "user_id": user_id, "total": pricing["total"]}
    save_order(order)
    return order

def notify_user(order, user_id):
    """Single responsibility: Notification."""
    send_email(user_id, f"Order {order['id']} confirmed")
```

**Benefits:**

- Each routine has single, testable responsibility
- Can modify pricing without touching validation
- Can reuse validate_order_request elsewhere
- Easy to understand each piece in isolation
- Clear names describe exactly what each does

## Benefits of Focused Routines

### 1. Easier to Understand

Small, focused routines are easier to comprehend:

- Can understand without seeing rest of system
- Name tells you what it does
- Implementation is short enough to hold in mind

### 2. Easier to Test

```python
# ✅ Easy to test focused routine
def calculate_tax(amount, rate):
    return amount * rate

# Test with various inputs, done

# ❌ Hard to test unfocused routine
def handle_order(...):
    # Does 8 things - need to test all 8 in combination
    # Need mocks for email, database, inventory, etc.
```

### 3. Easier to Modify

Focused routines have clear boundaries:

- Change pricing logic → modify calculate_pricing only
- Change validation → modify validate_order_request only
- Changes don't ripple unexpectedly

### 4. Easier to Reuse

```python
# ✅ Can reuse focused routines
def handle_order(...):
    validate_order_request(...)  # Reusable

def handle_return(...):
    validate_order_request(...)  # Same validation, different context
```

### 5. Reduces Complexity

Breaking into focused pieces makes each piece simpler:

- One routine: 200 lines, complex
- Four routines: 50 lines each, simple

**Mental load:** Understand 50 lines vs understand 200 lines.

## When Routine is Appropriately Long

**Some routines are naturally longer:**

1. **Extensive but straightforward validation** - Many simple checks in sequence
2. **State machines** - Many states and transitions
3. **Generated code** - Auto-generated switch statements
4. **Linear algorithms** - Many sequential steps with no natural boundaries

**Question:** Are there natural extraction points that would improve clarity?

**If no → keep as-is. If yes → extract.**

## Verification Checklist

For each routine, check:

- [ ] Does ONE thing (functional cohesion)?
- [ ] Description has no "and" connecting different actions?
- [ ] Name clearly describes the one thing it does?
- [ ] All statements at consistent abstraction level?
- [ ] Parameters < 7 (or grouped into object)?
- [ ] Length natural for its purpose (not artificially inflated)?
- [ ] Easy to write test case?
- [ ] Can understand without seeing rest of system?

**If any "no" → consider extracting.**

## Real-World Impact

From Code Complete:

- Functional cohesion is strongest, most maintainable
- Routines doing one thing are easiest to understand
- Most routines should be simple enough to name clearly
- Parameter count > 7 correlates with higher error rates

From baseline testing:

- Agent extracted helper functions (good instinct!)
- BUT orchestrator still did 8-10 things
- Each helper was focused, but main routine wasn't
- Grade: C (good instinct, incomplete application)

**With this skill:** Both helpers AND orchestrators stay focused.

## Integration with Other Skills

**For extracting during refactoring:** See skills/designing-before-coding - sometimes one pseudocode line explodes to many code lines, indicating need to extract

**For complexity reduction:** See skills/architecture/reducing-complexity - focused routines reduce mental juggling required
