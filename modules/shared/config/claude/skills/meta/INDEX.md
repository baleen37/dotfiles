# Meta Skills

Skills about skills - how to create and use the skills system.

## Available Skills

- skills/meta/installing-skills - Fork, clone, and symlink clank repo to ~/.claude/skills. Use for initial setup, installing clank for the first time.

- skills/meta/testing-skills-with-subagents - Iteratively test and bulletproof skills using pressure scenarios and rationalization analysis. Use after writing skills that enforce discipline or rules, before deploying skills agents might want to bypass.
