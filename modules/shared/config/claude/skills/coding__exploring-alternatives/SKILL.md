# Exploring Alternatives

## Overview

Don't settle for the first design you think of. Try multiple approaches, compare trade-offs, pick the best, THEN implement.

**Core principle:** Design is cheap to iterate. Code is expensive. Once you write code, emotional attachment makes it hard to throw away. Explore alternatives while iteration is still cheap.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of good design.**

## When to Use

**Always use before implementing:**

- Non-trivial features
- Complex algorithms
- System design decisions
- Refactoring approaches
- Architecture choices
- Data structure selection

**Especially when:**

- First idea feels complex
- Multiple viable approaches exist
- Stakes are high (production code, public APIs)
- Design will be hard to change later

**Warning signs you need this:**

- Jumping to implementation with first idea
- "This is the obvious way" (without considering alternatives)
- Solution feels forced or awkward
- Fighting the implementation
- Design keeps changing during coding

## The Exploration Process

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

**Before exploring solutions, clarify the problem:**

- What exactly are we solving?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the requirements?
- What are success criteria?

**If problem is unclear, exploring solutions is premature.**

### Step 2: Generate 2-3 Alternatives

**Don't stop at first idea. Generate at least 2 more.**

**Techniques for generating alternatives:**

1. **Different data structures:**
   - Array vs linked list vs tree vs hash table
   - List vs set vs dictionary

2. **Different algorithms:**
   - Iterative vs recursive
   - Brute force vs optimized
   - Different algorithmic approaches (sort-based vs hash-based)

3. **Different levels of abstraction:**
   - Direct implementation vs library
   - Custom code vs existing pattern
   - Simple specific vs generic flexible

4. **Different responsibility allocation:**
   - One class vs multiple
   - Function vs class
   - Inline vs extracted

5. **Different error handling:**
   - Exceptions vs return codes
   - Fail fast vs continue with defaults
   - Validate at boundary vs trust callers

**For each approach, sketch it in pseudocode or bullet points.**

### Step 3: Compare Trade-offs

**Evaluate each alternative against criteria:**

| Criterion        | Alternative 1  | Alternative 2  | Alternative 3 |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Simplicity       | Simple         | Complex        | Medium        |
| Performance      | Fast           | Slow           | Medium        |
| Maintainability  | Easy to modify | Hard to change | Medium        |
| Testability      | Easy to test   | Hard to test   | Medium        |
| Flexibility      | Rigid          | Very flexible  | Some flex     |
| Development time | Quick          | Slow           | Medium        |

**Which criteria matter most for this problem?**

### Step 4: Pick the Best

**Choose based on:**

- Requirements (which criteria actually matter)
- Simplicity (default to simplest that meets requirements)
- Long-term maintainability (code is read 10x more than written)

**Document why you picked it:**

- "Chose approach 2 because performance is critical and measurements show approach 1 is too slow"
- "Chose approach 1 because simplicity matters more than flexibility we don't need yet"

### Step 5: Implement

Only after comparing alternatives, implement the chosen approach.

**If implementation fights you → return to Step 2. You might have picked wrong alternative.**

## Quick Reference

| When                      | What to Explore          | Example Alternatives                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Data structure choice** | Different structures     | Array, LinkedList, HashMap, Tree          |
| **Algorithm choice**      | Different algorithms     | Iterative, Recursive, Different approach  |
| **Error handling**        | Different strategies     | Exceptions, Return codes, Defaults        |
| **Responsibility**        | Different decompositions | One class, Multiple classes, Functions    |
| **Abstraction level**     | Build vs use             | Custom implementation, Library, Framework |
| **Complexity trade-off**  | Simple vs flexible       | Specific solution, Generic solution       |

## Example: Validation Function

**Problem:** Validate user registration data

### Alternative 1: Manual Validation

```python
def validate_registration(data: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    if 'email' not in data:
        return False, "Missing email"
    if not re.match(email_pattern, data['email']):
        return False, "Invalid email"
    # ... validate each field manually
```

**Trade-offs:**

- ✅ Simple, no dependencies
- ✅ Full control
- ❌ Verbose, repetitive
- ❌ Easy to miss fields

### Alternative 2: Pydantic Model

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, Field

class RegistrationData(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    password: str = Field(min_length=8)
    username: str
    age: int = Field(ge=18)

def validate_registration(data: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    try:
        RegistrationData(**data)
        return True, ""
    except ValidationError as e:
        return False, str(e)
```

**Trade-offs:**

- ✅ Declarative, clear
- ✅ Comprehensive validation
- ✅ Less code
- ❌ Adds dependency
- ❌ Learning curve for library

### Alternative 3: Validator Class

```python
class RegistrationValidator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.errors = []

    def validate(self):
        self._validate_email()
        self._validate_password()
        self._validate_username()
        self._validate_age()
        return len(self.errors) == 0, ", ".join(self.errors)

    def _validate_email(self):
        # Focused validation method
```

**Trade-offs:**

- ✅ Organized, testable
- ✅ Easy to extend
- ✅ No dependencies
- ❌ More boilerplate
- ❌ Over-engineering for simple case

### Comparison

**For this problem:**

- If project already uses Pydantic: Choose Alternative 2
- If no dependencies allowed: Choose Alternative 1
- If validation will grow complex: Choose Alternative 3

**By exploring all three, you make informed decision instead of defaulting to first idea.**

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Implementing first idea:**

```
Think of approach → implement immediately → discover problems → hack fixes
```

**✅ Exploring alternatives:**

```
Think of approach → sketch it → think of alternative → sketch it → compare → pick best → implement cleanly
```

---

**❌ "This is obviously the best way":**

Without exploring, you don't know if it's best. Your "obvious" solution might be suboptimal.

**✅ "Let me try two other approaches to confirm this is best":**

Even if first idea wins, exploring validates your choice.

---

**❌ Exploring in code:**

Writing full implementations of multiple approaches wastes time and creates emotional attachment.

**✅ Exploring in pseudocode/sketches:**

Quick, cheap, easy to discard.

## If You Already Implemented First Idea

**You implemented without exploring alternatives. Now what?**

**No exceptions:**

- Don't claim "it works so it's fine"
- Don't skip exploration "to save time"
- Don't just document why you picked this approach (you didn't pick, you defaulted)

**Required steps:**

1. **Acknowledge the sunk cost** - Hours spent are already gone
2. **Sketch 2 alternatives** - Don't look at your implementation while sketching
3. **Include current implementation as Alternative 1** - Describe what it does
4. **Compare all 3 honestly** - Is your implementation actually the best?
5. **Decide:**
   - If current code is best approach: Keep it, document the alternatives you rejected
   - If different approach is better: Implement it (sunk cost is already sunk)

**This isn't punishment. It's good engineering.**

Working code that's not the best approach = technical debt. Pay it now or pay interest later.

**Time investment:**

- Sketch 2 alternatives: 5 minutes
- Compare: 3 minutes
- Decision: 1 minute
- Total: 9 minutes to validate you chose well (or discover you didn't)

**9 minutes now vs hours of maintenance later.**

## Red Flags - STOP and Explore

**Before implementing:**

- First idea → ready to code (haven't explored alternatives)
- "This is the obvious approach" (without checking others)
- "Let's try this and see" (no comparison with alternatives)
- Solution feels forced (might be wrong approach)
- Can't articulate why this approach over others

**During implementing:**

- Fighting the implementation (wrong approach chosen?)
- Discovering limitations you didn't foresee
- Adding hack after hack to make it work
- Implementation much more complex than expected

**All of these mean: Stop. Explore alternatives in pseudocode.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse                                       | Reality                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "First idea is obviously best"               | Without exploring, you don't know. Try 2 more anyway.             |
| "Don't want to waste time"                   | 5 minutes exploring saves hours of bad implementation.            |
| "This approach already works"                | Working ≠ best. Other approaches might be simpler.                |
| "I'm experienced, I know the right approach" | Experience creates bias. Check your intuition.                    |
| "Problem is too simple to need alternatives" | Even simple problems benefit. Takes 2 minutes.                    |
| "Already started coding, too late"           | Sunk cost fallacy. Still cheaper to explore now than debug later. |
| "Other approaches won't work"                | How do you know without trying them?                              |

## Verification Checklist

Before marking design complete:

- [ ] Sketched at least 2 alternative approaches (3+ for critical code)
- [ ] Compared alternatives against relevant criteria
- [ ] Can articulate why chosen approach is best
- [ ] Documented trade-offs considered
- [ ] Consciously rejected other approaches (not just ignored them)

**Can't check all boxes? Return to Step 2 (generate alternatives).**

## When to Stop Exploring

**Explore 2-3 alternatives minimum. Stop when:**

1. **Clear winner emerges** - One approach obviously superior for your criteria
2. **Diminishing returns** - Alternative 4 and 5 aren't meaningfully different
3. **Good enough found** - Approach meets requirements simply and clearly

**Don't:**

- Stop at first idea (always explore at least 2)
- Explore forever (analysis paralysis)
- Explore 10 alternatives (2-3 usually sufficient)

**Balance:** Enough exploration to find good solutions, not so much you never implement.

## Real-World Impact

From Code Complete:

- "Don't settle for the first design you think of"
- Design is nondeterministic - multiple valid solutions exist
- Trying alternatives in pseudocode is cheap
- Design mistakes caught before coding save time

From baseline testing:

- Agents implemented first idea immediately
- No evidence of exploring alternatives
- No consideration of libraries (Pydantic for validation)
- No comparison of approaches
- Grade: F for iteration

**With this skill:** Systematic exploration before implementation.
