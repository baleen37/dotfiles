</objective>

<workflow>
  <step name="Pre-PR Validation" number="1">
    - **Branch Sync**: Ensure the current branch is up-to-date with the target branch (usually `main`) by merging or rebasing to prevent conflicts.
      - **IF SYNC FAILS**: Report the specific Git error (e.g., "Merge/rebase failed due to conflicts.") and **STOP**.
    - **Quality Checks**: Identify and run all relevant local quality checks (e.g., linting, testing, type checking) based on project configuration (e.g., `package.json` scripts, `Makefile` targets).
      - **IF VALIDATION FAILS**: Report the specific failure (e.g., "Linting failed. Please fix the issues before proceeding.") and **STOP**.
    - **Working Directory Status**: Use `git status` to confirm there are no uncommitted or untracked files.
      - **IF UNCLEAN**: Report "Working directory is not clean. Please commit or stash changes." and **STOP**.
  </step>

  <step name="PR Creation" number="2">
    - **Initialize PR**: Execute `gh pr create` to begin the process.
      - **IF GH PR CREATE FAILS**: Report the specific `gh` CLI error (e.g., "Failed to create PR. Check GitHub authentication.") and **STOP**.
    - **Generate Title**: Automatically create a title following the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`) based on recent commit messages and changes. Must be clear and concise.
    - **Create Description**: Generate comprehensive description by:
      - Filling in the project's PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) if it exists
      - Analyzing commit messages, changed files, and branch purpose
      - Populating sections like "Summary", "Changes", "Testing", and "Related Issues"
      - Using proper GitHub linking syntax (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`)
    - **Suggest Metadata**: Recommend appropriate labels and assignees based on:
      - Nature of the changes
      - Affected files and directories
      - Project ownership patterns
      - Confirm with user before applying
  </step>

  <step name="Post-Creation Setup" number="3">
    - **Assign Reviewers**: Assign at least one relevant reviewer to the PR. Confirm with user first.
      - **IF ASSIGNMENT FAILS**: Report the error but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
    - **Apply Labels**: Add appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `needs-review`). Confirm with user first.
      - **IF LABELING FAILS**: Report the error but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
    - **Auto-Merge Setup**: If project guidelines or user explicitly allow, enable auto-merge with appropriate strategy.
      - **IF AUTO-MERGE FAILS**: Report the error but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
    - **CI Monitoring**: Monitor the initial CI run to catch any immediate failures.
      - **IF CI FAILS IMMEDIATELY**: Report "CI checks failed immediately. Please review and fix the issues." but **CONTINUE**.
