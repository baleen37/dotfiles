To create a high-quality, review-ready Pull Request for the current feature branch that adheres to project standards and facilitates smooth code review processes.
</objective>

<workflow>
  <step name="Pre-PR Validation" number="1">
    - **Parallel Validation**: Execute the following checks in parallel for faster validation:
      - **Branch Sync**: Ensure the current branch is up-to-date with the target branch (usually `main`) by merging or rebasing to prevent conflicts.
      - **Quality Checks**: Check if pre-commit hooks are configured (`.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists).
      - **Working Directory Status**: Use `git status` to confirm there are no uncommitted or untracked files.
    - **Error Handling**: For any validation that fails:
      - **IF SYNC FAILS**: Report the specific Git error (e.g., "Merge/rebase failed due to conflicts.") and **STOP**.
      - **IF PRE-COMMIT EXISTS**: Trust that pre-commit hooks will handle quality validation automatically during commits. No manual checks needed.
      - **IF NO PRE-COMMIT**: Remind user to run quality checks manually (e.g., linting, testing, type checking) before creating PR, but do not execute them automatically.
      - **IF UNCLEAN**: Report "Working directory is not clean. Please commit or stash changes." and **STOP**.
  </step>

  <step name="PR Creation" number="2">
    - **Initialize PR**: Execute `gh pr create` to begin the process.
      - **IF GH PR CREATE FAILS**: Report the specific `gh` CLI error (e.g., "Failed to create PR. Check GitHub authentication.") and **STOP**.
    - **Generate Title**: Automatically create a title following the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`) based on recent commit messages and changes. Must be clear and concise.
    - **Create Description**: Generate comprehensive description by:
      - Filling in the project's PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) if it exists
      - Analyzing commit messages, changed files, and branch purpose
      - Populating sections like "Summary", "Changes", "Testing", and "Related Issues"
      - Using proper GitHub linking syntax (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`)
    - **Suggest Metadata**: Recommend appropriate labels and assignees based on:
      - Nature of the changes
      - Affected files and directories
      - Project ownership patterns
  </step>

  <step name="Post-Creation Setup" number="3">
    - **Parallel Operations**: Execute the following operations in parallel for faster setup:
      - **Assign Reviewers**: Assign at least one relevant reviewer to the PR.
      - **Apply Labels**: Add appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `needs-review`).
      - **Auto-Merge Setup**: If project guidelines or user explicitly allow, enable auto-merge with appropriate strategy.
      - **CI Monitoring**: Monitor the initial CI run to catch any immediate failures.
    - **Error Handling**: For any parallel operation that fails:
      - **IF ASSIGNMENT/LABELING/AUTO-MERGE FAILS**: Report the error but **CONTINUE** if PR was created.
      - **IF CI FAILS IMMEDIATELY**: Report "CI checks failed immediately. Please review and fix the issues." but **CONTINUE**.
  </step>
</workflow>

<constraints>
  - **NEVER** push unfinished or untested code
  - PR title **MUST** follow the Conventional Commits specification
  - PR body **MUST NOT** be empty and must provide sufficient context
  - **MUST** include comprehensive test coverage information in the PR description
  - **ALWAYS** link to related issues using GitHub's linking syntax
  - **MUST** respect project's contribution guidelines and merge strategies
</constraints>

<validation>
  - The Pull Request is successfully created on GitHub
  - The PR is correctly linked to corresponding issues
  - All required CI checks are triggered and running
  - PR follows project standards and conventions
  - Reviewers and labels are appropriately assigned
</validation>
