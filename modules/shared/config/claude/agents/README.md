## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed and configured
- Access to the `~/.claude/agents/` directory

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-subagents.git
   cd claude-code-subagents
   ```

2. **Copy subagents to Claude Code's directory:**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   cp *.md ~/.claude/agents/

   # Windows
   copy *.md %USERPROFILE%\.claude\agents\
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Code** to load the new subagents

## Usage

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code automatically delegates to the appropriate subagent based on:
- Task context and requirements
- Keywords in your request
- File types being worked on
- Error messages or issues encountered

### Explicit Invocation
You can explicitly request a specific subagent:

```
"Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
"Have the security-auditor review this authentication code"
"Get the performance-engineer to optimize this function"
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: Automatic Code Review
```
User: "I just finished implementing the user authentication feature"
Claude: [Automatically invokes code-reviewer after detecting new code]
```

#### Example 2: Debugging Help
```
User: "I'm getting a TypeError in my React component"
Claude: [Automatically invokes debugger to analyze the error]
```

#### Example 3: Performance Optimization
```
User: "This query is running slowly"
Claude: [Automatically invokes database-optimizer to analyze and optimize]
```

#### Example 4: Crypto Trading
```
User: "Help me build a bot to trade on Binance"
Claude: [Automatically invokes crypto-trader to build trading system]
```

#### Example 5: DeFi Strategy
```
User: "I want to optimize my yield farming across protocols"
Claude: [Automatically invokes defi-strategist to design yield strategies]
```

## Subagent Format

Each subagent follows this structure:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: When this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2  # Optional - defaults to all tools
---

System prompt defining the subagent's role and capabilities
```

### Key Components:
- **name**: Unique identifier for the subagent
- **description**: Triggers automatic invocation
- **tools**: Specific tools the subagent can use (optional)
- **system prompt**: Detailed instructions and expertise

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Trust automatic delegation** - Claude Code knows when to use each specialist
2. **Be specific when needed** - Explicitly mention subagents for targeted help
3. **Combine specialists** - Complex tasks may benefit from multiple experts
4. **Provide context** - More information helps subagents work effectively

### For Development
1. **Let subagents focus** - Each should excel in one domain
2. **Write clear descriptions** - Help Claude Code know when to invoke
3. **Include examples** - Show how the subagent should respond
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure subagents work well together

## Troubleshooting

### Subagents not loading
1. Check the installation directory:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/agents/
   ```
2. Ensure files have `.md` extension
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Check file permissions

### Subagent not being invoked
1. Use explicit invocation to test
2. Check the subagent's description
3. Verify the subagent file is valid Markdown
4. Look for syntax errors in the frontmatter

### Performance issues
1. Avoid overlapping subagent descriptions
2. Keep system prompts focused
3. Use specific tool restrictions when appropriate

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add a new subagent:

1. **Create a new file**: `subagent-name.md`
2. **Follow the format**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: your-subagent
   description: Clear description of when to use
   ---

   Detailed system prompt...
   ```

3. **Guidelines**:
   - Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names
   - Write clear, specific descriptions
   - Include concrete examples in the prompt
   - Test with various scenarios
   - Document any special requirements

4. **Submit a PR** with:
   - The new subagent file
   - Updated README listing
   - Example usage scenarios

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Tool Restrictions
Some subagents specify which tools they can use:

```markdown
---
name: documentation-writer
tools: Read, Write, Edit
---
```

This improves performance and security by limiting capabilities.

### Subagent Chaining
Claude Code can use multiple subagents in sequence:
1. `code-reviewer` identifies issues
2. `debugger` investigates errors
3. `security-auditor` checks vulnerabilities
