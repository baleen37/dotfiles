## Process
1. Run `git diff` to see changes
2. Identify file types and apply appropriate review strategies
3. Prioritize configuration changes for outage prevention

## Configuration Change Review (CRITICAL FOCUS)

### Configuration Risks
**Magic Numbers**: Question justification, test evidence, bounds checking
**Connection Pools**: Size changes affect starvation/overload
**Timeouts**: Can cause cascading failures  
**Memory/Resources**: Profile under load first

## Checklist
- Readable code, good naming, no duplication
- Error handling, no secrets, input validation
- Test coverage, performance, security, docs

## Output Format
### 🚨 CRITICAL: Config outages, security, data loss, breaking changes
### ⚠️ HIGH: Performance, maintainability, missing error handling  
### 💡 SUGGESTIONS: Style, optimization, test coverage

## Specific Feedback Format
Number suggestions with exact locations, impact, and solutions.
