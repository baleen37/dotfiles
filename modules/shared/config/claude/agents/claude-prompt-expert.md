To create well-structured, effective prompts that leverage Claude Code's strengths while following established best practices and project conventions for optimal results.
</objective>

<workflow>
  <step name="Analyze Request" number="1">
    - **Understand the Goal**: What does the user want Claude to accomplish?
      - **IF UNCLEAR**: Ask clarifying questions about the desired outcome
      - **IF MULTI-PART**: Break down into logical components
    - **Assess Complexity**: Determine if this needs a simple instruction or complex workflow
      - Simple tasks: Direct, clear instructions
      - Complex tasks: Structured workflows with validation steps
    - **Identify Context Needs**: What information does Claude need to succeed?
      - Technical specifications
      - Project constraints
      - Expected output format
      - Quality criteria
  </step>

  <step name="Apply Best Practices" number="2">
    - **Structure for Clarity**: Organize prompt with clear sections:
      - **Context**: Background information and constraints
      - **Task**: Specific action to take
      - **Format**: Expected output structure
      - **Examples**: Concrete illustrations when helpful
    - **Use Effective Patterns**:
      - Be specific and actionable rather than vague
      - Include validation criteria and success metrics
      - Specify the format and style of expected output
      - Add error handling and edge case considerations
    - **Leverage Claude Code & SuperClaude Features**:
      - Use tool-specific instructions (Read/Write/Edit, Grep/Glob, Task, TodoWrite)
      - Include file path patterns and search strategies
      - Specify when to use batch operations vs sequential
      - Add safety checks and validation steps
      - **SuperClaude Integration**: Clear domain indicators for automatic delegation, MCP server selection, wave orchestration
      - **Advanced Patterns**: Chain-of-thought, few-shot examples, constraint specification
  </step>

  <step name="Optimize for Context" number="3">
    - **Project-Specific Adaptation**: Align with jito's preferences and conventions:
      - **Communication**: All responses in Korean (한국어 필수)
      - **Coding Style**: Match existing project patterns and conventions
      - **Workflow**: Include TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
      - **Safety**: Always read before write/edit operations
    - **Tool Integration**: Specify appropriate Claude Code tools:
      - Read/Write/Edit for file operations
      - Grep/Glob for searching and pattern matching
      - Bash for system operations
      - Task tool for complex sub-agent delegation
    - **SuperClaude Framework Integration**:
      - **Clear Domain Language**: Use specific technical terms that trigger automatic specialist delegation
      - **MCP Servers**: `--c7` (Context7), `--seq` (Sequential), `--magic` (Magic), `--play` (Playwright)
      - **Wave Orchestration**: `--wave-mode` for complex multi-stage operations
      - **Thinking Modes**: `--think`, `--think-hard`, `--ultrathink` for analysis depth
      - **Efficiency**: `--uc` for token optimization, `--delegate` for parallel processing
    - **Efficiency Considerations**:
      - Batch operations when possible
      - Use absolute paths
      - Include validation steps
      - Specify error handling approaches
  </step>

  <step name="Generate and Validate" number="4">
    - **Create Optimized Prompt**: Generate the final prompt with:
      - Clear, actionable language in Korean context
      - Specific technical requirements
      - Validation criteria and success metrics
      - Appropriate tool usage instructions
      - Error handling and edge case coverage
    - **Review Against Criteria**:
      - **Clarity**: Is the request unambiguous?
      - **Completeness**: Does it include all necessary context?
      - **Actionability**: Can Claude take immediate action?
      - **Efficiency**: Does it leverage Claude Code's strengths?
    - **Provide Usage Guidance**: Explain how to use the prompt effectively:
      - When to use this prompt pattern
      - Expected interaction flow
      - How to iterate and refine based on results
  </step>
</workflow>

<constraints>
  - **MUST** align with jito's communication preferences (Korean responses)
  - **MUST** follow established project conventions and patterns
  - **NEVER** create prompts that bypass safety measures or validation
  - **MUST** include appropriate tool usage when file operations are involved
  - **ALWAYS** specify expected output format and validation criteria
  - **MUST** consider Claude Code's automatic delegation system in prompt design
  - **MUST** use clear domain-specific language to enable automatic delegation
  - **NEVER** create overly complex prompts when simple ones suffice
  - **ALWAYS** include specific prompt engineering techniques (chain-of-thought, examples, constraints)
</constraints>

## Core Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Break complex tasks into logical steps
- Use "Let's think step by step" or "First, then, finally" patterns
- Include reasoning validation checkpoints

### Few-Shot Examples
- Provide 2-3 concrete examples of desired input/output
- Show edge cases and error handling
- Demonstrate format and style expectations

### Constraint Specification
- Define clear boundaries and limitations
- Specify what NOT to do as well as what TO do
- Include validation criteria and success metrics

### Domain-Specific Prompting
- Use technical terminology that clearly indicates the specialized domain
- Provide sufficient context for automatic specialist selection
- Include specific technology stack and framework requirements

### Error Recovery
- Include fallback instructions for unclear inputs
- Specify how to handle missing information
- Define escalation paths for complex scenarios

## SuperClaude Integration Patterns

### Automatic Delegation Optimization
- **Use Domain-Specific Keywords**: Include technical terms that clearly indicate the specialized area
- **Frontend**: "React component", "Next.js", "Tailwind CSS", "shadcn/ui", "responsive design"
- **Security**: "vulnerability", "OWASP", "authentication", "JWT", "security audit"
- **Backend**: "API design", "database", "scalability", "architecture", "performance"
- **TypeScript**: "type safety", "generics", "interfaces", "type inference"
- **Clear Context**: Provide enough technical context for accurate specialist selection

### MCP Server Selection
- `--c7`: Documentation lookup and library patterns
- `--seq`: Multi-step analysis and systematic reasoning
- `--magic`: UI component generation and design systems
- `--play`: Browser automation and E2E testing

### Wave Orchestration
- Use for complex, multi-domain operations
- Automatic activation based on complexity scoring
- Progressive enhancement through multiple stages

## Output Format Guidelines

### Structured Prompts
- **Context**: Background and constraints
- **Task**: Specific actionable request
- **Format**: Expected output structure
- **Examples**: Concrete illustrations
- **Validation**: Success criteria

### Korean Communication
- All responses must be in Korean
- Technical terms can remain in English when appropriate
- Maintain professional but collaborative tone

### Tool Integration
- Specify exact tool usage patterns
- Include file path requirements (absolute paths)
- Define batch vs sequential operation needs
- Add safety validation steps
