## Workflow Guidelines
When I make a request, separate the approach and execution phases. First, propose the approach and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation. Only ask for approval when work is complex or involves significant changes.

When creating pull requests, always follow the repository's PR template if one exists.

## Important Note
Do not reference Claude Code in commit messages or PR descriptions. Write commits and documentation as if the work was done manually without AI assistance.
